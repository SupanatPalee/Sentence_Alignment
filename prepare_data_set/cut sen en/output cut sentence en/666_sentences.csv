A redesign is a crucial activity in engineering design process in order to achieve good product designs.
"However, this leads to resource consume."
"In order to reducing risk in design process, this paper presents the application of Quality function deployment (QFD) and Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) techniques to develop a design methodology that can leading to clearly define design problems and constraints at the beginning of design process."
An implementation to the case study showed that a design revision occurs only 1 time after the prototype test.
The result of using the device to move the 50 kg weight package in the warehouse found that the operation can be carried out using only 1 employee without having to use force from the body.
"As a result, it can reduce both the number of workers and injuries of employees."
