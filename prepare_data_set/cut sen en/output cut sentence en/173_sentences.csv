This paper presents mathematical model of the electric vehicle drive systems.
"This proposed mathematical model focuses on the traction force, the battery, the three-phase induction motor, and the whole parameters of the mathematical model."
Indirect vector control is used for the control method of electric vehicle drive systems.
The parameters of the controller have been designed to be suitable for the speed control of an electric vehicle.
The hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation was applied to confirm the speed control performance of electric vehicles.
The MATLAB/Simulink program was used with the TMS320F28335 microcontroller board for HIL simulation.
The results of the simulation show that the proposed mathematical model of the electric vehicle drive system is correct.
It can be applied to the design of the speed control system of an electric vehicle.
"Moreover, the proposed indirect vector control can provide a good performance for the speed control of an electric vehicle."
