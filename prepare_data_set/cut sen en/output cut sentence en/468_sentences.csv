The objective of this research is to improve working methods of punch insert for part case gear after aluminum molding injection.
The cause and effect diagram were used to define root cause of the proposed problems.
It was found that the sub-cause was caused by the original method of knocking out the insert.
There was a workpiece that had not been knocked out resulting in damage to the customer's tools if continue to machine the workpiece.
"Therefore, the new improved method of working was done by designing and setting up a method to punch the insert from the workpiece in the propeller assembly process as well as being able to check the workpiece simultaneously."
These allow all workpieces with punch inserts to be removed.
This can reduce a working step from 9 steps to 8 steps.
"Working time before improvement was 68.4 seconds per piece, after improvement was 58.3 seconds per piece, which is reduced to 10.1 seconds per piece, accounted for 14.76%."
