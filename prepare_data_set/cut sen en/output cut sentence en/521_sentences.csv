This research was to study drying of hardy waterlily (Pink Beauty) by vacuum pulse and infrared combined with embed by silica sand.
"This research was conducted by drying temperature at 40°C, absolute pressure at 5 kPa and 15 kPa and vacuum pulse ratio at 12:2 and 15:4."
"Objectives of this research were to study of drying kinetic, specific energy consumption and change of color of Pink Beauty."
The results revealed drying time was decreased and reduction rate of moisture of Pink Beauty was increased by reduce absolute pressure from 15 kPa to 5 kPa and decrease vacuum pulse ratio from 12:2 to 15:4.
"Moreover, reduction of absolute pressure from 15 kPa to 5 kPa affected to decrease of specific energy consumption and total color difference (DE) of Pink Beauty."
"However, drying of Pink Beauty by vacuum pulse ratio of 15:4 at absolute pressure 5 kPa effected to shortest drying time at 8 hour, lowest specific energy consumption at 0.74 MJ/gwater evap."
and minimal total color difference (E=2.68)
