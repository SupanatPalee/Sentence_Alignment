"This research aimed to evaluated the durability of two diesel engines, four-stroke, single cylinder."
The diesel and B40 were compared.
The continuously exhaust gas for 300 hours at 1400 rpm was inspected.
"The results show that, the agricultural engine using B40 emitted exhaust gases at an average of 8.3 ◦C, higher than the diesel engine."
"The emission test, the engine using B40 showed averages of CO, CO2 and O2 close to the engine using diesel."
"NO and NOX of the engine using B40 average was 189.87 ppm, which was 48.13 ppm higher than the diesel engine (Not higher than standard)."
Engine using B40 (Yang-na fuel) emission black smoke are average 2% higher than diesel.
All test results indicate that B40 can be used to replace diesel.
