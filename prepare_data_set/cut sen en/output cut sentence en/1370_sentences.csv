This paper presents a study investigate the color-switching behavior of polydiacetylenefabricated by mixing different surfactants on acid-base.
"The polydiacetylene solution is prepared from 10,12 pentacosadinoic acid monomer."
"The mixing of three type surfactants (Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) andTriton x-100) in various ratios in PCDA system may result different color transition property."
"We found that, The mixture of poly(PCDA:CTAB) (1:0.1) and ,poly(PCDA:SDS) (1:0.5 1:1 1:2 1:5) could be prepared blue phase upon UV-irradiation."
The system of poly(PCDA:TritonX-100)with1:0.1 1:0.5 1:5 also exhibit blue phase.
The pure poly(PCDA) show red phase at pH 9.
The poly(PCDA:SDS) ratio1:2 also exhibit red phase at pH 9 which is the lowest pH comparing the orther mixture.
"In addition, the poly(PCDA) and poly(PCDA:SDS) ratio 1:2 were facricated on filter paper."
"The color transition of poly(PCDA) and pol(PCDA:SDS) reponse in pH as 11 and 10, pespectively."
This work is basic knowledge to develop poly(PCDA) material to apply for sensing acid-base.
