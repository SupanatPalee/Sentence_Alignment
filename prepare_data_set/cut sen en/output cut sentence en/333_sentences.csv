"This research presents sulfate and acid resistances with bonding strength and effect of a sustained load on the bonding strength of deformed bar in concrete using cement mortar containing nanosilica with particle sizes of 12, 20, and 40 nm."
"For the sulfate and acid resistances investigation, the compressive strength, expansions and weight loss including the bonding strength and sustained load of cement mortar with various nanosilica."
The test results indicated that the particle sizes of nanosilica directly affected the sulfate and acid resistances.
Nanosilica with particles size of 40 nm gave the highest compressive strength while the expansion and weight loss of cement mortar lower than those of cement mortar with Portland cement types I and V. In the part of bonding strength and effect of a sustained load on the bonding strength of deformed bar in concrete using cement mortar containing nanosilica.
The results showed that the particle sizes of nanosilica also affected the bonding strength and creep behavior.
"Cement mortar with nanosilica particle size of 40 nm gave a highest bonding strength and sustained load than those of nanosilica particle size of 12 and 20 nm, including the epoxy resin."
