This research is to develop the teaching and learning of PLC programming for control of pneumatic systems.
"The research steps are as follows: Step 1: Develop a practice set for programming PLCs to control pneumatic systems, starting with studying the details of the course content and designing a practice set."
This research has designed a set of workpiece handling equipment and provided the materials used to create a practice set.
Then proceeded to create a practice set and teaching materials for a PLC programing practice set.
"After that, the developed practice set was given to a sample group of 15 experts to evaluate its appropriateness."
The results of research found that the developed PLC programming practice set and teaching materials were suitability at a high level.
Step 2 Evaluate efficiency in teaching and learning for PLC programing to control pneumatic systems.
"The researcher took the developed PLC programming practice set and tested it with a purposive sampling group of 23 third-year mechanical engineering students, Faculty of Technical Education, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi."
"The result research was found that the efficiency of teaching and learning was effective 84.96/82.40, which shows that the practice set can be used in teaching and learning effectively."
