The purpose of this research was study the improvement of working methods in the production of the Herbal Medicine Process and to compare the working efficiency before and after with standard time.
"In order to analyze number of process, we can be separated work in flow process chart were 26 processes (before improvement) and identify problem with the 6W-1H technique in 5 processes."
"Therefore, we presented the guidelines for using ECRS principles in the work process as follows: 1) It was found that unnecessary movements in the fifth and twenty-six processes proposed eliminating work, 2) Work delay in process ten used to make work easier by equipment and 3) In the fourteenth and seventeenth processes, workstations are not related to work, so removed the workstations to simplify work in work process."
"The research result was highlighted that, the number of after improvement in the flow process chart were 25 processes (after improvement) and time considered as follows: the selected time before improvement of 2,492.10 minutes compared with after improvement of 2,469.83 minutes to decrease 0.89%, the normal time before improvement of 2,855.47 minutes compared with after improvement of 2,814.91 minutes to decrease 1.42% and the standard time before improvement of 3,027.70 minutes compared with after improvement of 2,982.36 minutes to decrease 1.50%"
