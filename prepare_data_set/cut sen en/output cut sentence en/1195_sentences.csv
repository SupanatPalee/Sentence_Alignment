"Industrial washing machines are commonly used in the industrial part washing process.Since one of the substances used in the process is flammable liquid, there is a high risk of firethat may lead to human injury and property damage."
This article presents the design of a fireprotection system for a 2.5 × 8.8 × 2.1 m industrial washing machine in accordance with the NFPA12.
The heat release rate of a flammable liquid is 841.7 kW/m2.
"The appropriate fire protectionsystem is a Rate-by-Area, Local Application, carbon dioxide system with 2 nozzles installed ata height of 1 meter over a dipping tank at a flow rate of 24 kg per minute per nozzle for 30seconds.The design validation was done by a fire dynamics simulation with the Fire DynamicsSimulator (FDS) program at worst case scenario when the fire occurred in the dipping tank thatcontained flammable liquid."
"From the simulation, it was found that the fire extinguishing systemwas able to extinguish the fire within 11 seconds where the temperature decreased to a normallevel according to the NFPA 12, which required a maximum extinguished time of 30 seconds andthe oxygen content decreased below 5% within 20seconds, which was a non-flammable state."
