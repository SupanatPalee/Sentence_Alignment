This article presents effects of factors affecting compressive strength and flexural strength of polypropylene fiber-reinforced self-compacting concrete.
"The studied factors were fiber content of 0-2 kg/m3, and slump flow with small value of 450-550 mm and standard value of 600-700 mm."
Another one factor was casting position which was conducted at the center and the edge of beams.
"The compressive strength test and flexural test were in accordance with ASTM C39 and ASTM C1609, respectively."
"The results showed that the compressive strength slightly increased approximately of 5% by increasing fiber content of 1 kg/m3, compared to the specimen without fiber."
"On the other hand, it decreased approximately of 20% by increasing fiber content to 2 kg/m3."
"The flexural strength obviously increased approximately 40% and up to 220% by adding fiber content of 1 and 2 kg/m3, respectively."
The casting position and slump flow value had no significant impacts on flexural strength of concrete with 1 kg/m3 fiber content.
"However, there was significant impacts on concrete with 2 kg/m3."
This research can be used as additional data to maximize the benefits of polypropylene fiber-reinforced self-compacting concrete as flexural members.
