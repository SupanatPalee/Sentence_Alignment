The objectives of this research were 1) Create and find the efficiency of the Control Programming Training Package.
2) Study the learning progress of students studying with the Control Programming Training Package ago analog and digital signals; 3) to study the satisfaction of students studying with the training package.
control programming with analog and digital signals.
The research was designed and developed     a training program for controlling programming skills.
with analog and digital signals by allowing experts to evaluate and find work efficiency before applying it to the sample group of students.
"The statistics used to analyze the data were mean, standard deviation."
The hypothesis was tested with Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test.
"The research results showed that: 1) a training program for programming skills with analog and digital signals The quality was at the highest level ( = 4.68, S.D.= 0.21 ) and efficiency was 83.57/82.38."
2) the students lenining progres after learning through the programming training package.
significantly higher than was that before using the package at the .05 level 3) the students' satisfaction towards the control programming training package was at the highest level.
