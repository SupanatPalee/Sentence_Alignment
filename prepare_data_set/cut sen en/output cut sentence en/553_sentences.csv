This research aims to study and modification of the solid fuel of char pellets from cow manure.
"The effects of size, pressure, temperature and time of pyrolysis by pellets from cow manure."
These raw materials are pelletized without the use of binder.
"With three pellets of diameter 1 cm, 1.5 cm and 2 cm at 1 cm length, with hydraulic system, it was found that the optimum time and temperature in this study were 30 min, pyrolysis temperature 400 ÂºC."
"It also found that the pressure in the pellets influence of heat on char pellets from cow manure, which the diameter of 1 cm at the pellet pressure of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 bar the char pellets from cow manures had the heating values of 9,750, 9,820, 10,430, 10,520 and 10,782 kJ/kg, respectively."
"And the pellet pressure of diameter 70 bar at pellets of diameter 1 cm, 1.5 cm and 2 cm the char pellets from cow manures had the heating values of 10,782 11,279 and11,682 kJ/kg, respectively."
The optimum pellet pressure is 70 bars without the use of binder.
It saves energy and costs.
And biomass heating and solid fuel pellets obtained with other solid fuels were similar.
"As a result, cow manure is suitable as a source of energy because it is easily available and cheap."
