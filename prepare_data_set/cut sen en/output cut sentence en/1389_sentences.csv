This paper presents an analytical thinking and an outcome-based learning (OBL) for computer engineering students.
A student-centered education is used with the efforts for understanding the analytical thinking on basic electronics to develop the soft-skills and knowledge management.
Electronic devices are the main devices on many applications in the digital world.
The objective of this paper is to introduce mainly the basic concept of electronics on computer engineering course.
"Based on OBL approach, the teaching effectiveness and student outcomes are evaluated by the results of assessment."
"Results show that students can achieve the basic knowledge on electronics, even it is hard to improve the analytical thinking within a course of basic electronics."
"Moreover, this development is a fundamental knowledge for the computer engineering students to create an innovation in the electrical engineering field for the future."
