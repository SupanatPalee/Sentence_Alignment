The aim of this research is to improve adhesive wear resistance in ironing of aluminum alloy cups by utilizing modification of the die surface with shot peening and post-polishing.
"The dies were made of TiCN-based cermet with three different surface conditions, polished, shot-peened (Ra = 0.08 ~ 0.10 µm) and shot-peened (Ra = 0.14 ~ 0.18 µm) surfaces."
Workpiece material was aluminum alloy A3003-O sheets.
The aluminum alloy sheets were formed into cups by a deep drawing process.
"Before ironing, liquid lubricant was applied onto the die and cup surfaces."
The ironing ratio was changed to accelerate occurrence of adhesive wear.
"The results showed that comparing to the smooth polished die, the shot-peened die (Ra = 0.08 ~ 0.10 µm) succeeded in ironing cups at a high ironing ratio without adhesion of the cup material on the die."
The adhesive wear resistance was improved because dimples on the surface structured by shot peening helped retaining and supplying the lubricant into the die-cup interface during the ironing.
