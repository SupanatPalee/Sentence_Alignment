"This paper presents using a SCADA model system in prediction, the lifetime of SF6 12 kV/1600A-2500A/40 kA gas circuit breaker to prevent the damage of an 11 kV power supply system in a switchgear from the deterioration of the main contacts and arcing contacts, inside the gas circuit breaker because of the short circuit current during operation."
The SCADA will predict the lifetime of a circuit breaker from the deterioration of the electrical property of material equation of the main contacts and arcing contacts.
The result of two-times virtual short circuit current testing in the SCADA model system at the first phase of SF6 gas circuit breaker of 36.9 and 40.05 kA.
"Found that the SCADA model system could display accurately the numeric value of the predictions by 8,636 and 7,034 times, respectively."
