"This paper proposes the simulation and application of mathematical equations which concern the locus of complex power, operating point and stability of the three phase synchronous machine."
"The results of simulation can be illustrated through Microsoft excel, a popular platform for general computing."
"Moreover, the simulation results of the locus of complex power can be visualized graphically."
"Such visualization, once analyzed, can estimate the operating point and stability limit of the three phase synchronous machine, respectively."
"In addition, the proposed method can be utilized in designing and studying of the characteristic of stability of the three phase synchronous machine."
