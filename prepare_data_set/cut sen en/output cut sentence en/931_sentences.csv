"This study involved the design and construction of a thermal plastic molding machine for the production of frozen fairy shrimp trays in Khlong Saamprung community, Chum Saeng district, Nakhon Sawan province."
"The structure, made of steel, is 100 cm wide, 120 cm long, and 130 cm high."
"It uses 3-phase electric power, 380 volts, and 50 Hertz."
There are 12 infrared heat plates to heat the plastic sheets up to 300 Â°C.
"The mold can produce parts with a maximum width and length of 250 x 300 mm, and a maximum thickness of 0.5 mm with automatic PLC function control (PLC)."
After performance testing and break-even point analysis it can be concluded that a temperature of 250 degrees Celsius is the most suitable temperature for the production of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic trays with 20 seconds heating time and 275 seconds forming time.
The cycle time is equal to 360 seconds or 6 minutes.
The mold can produce 160 plastic trays per day.
"The break-even point is 179.25 days or 28,680 pieces, representing 8 hours of work per day."
