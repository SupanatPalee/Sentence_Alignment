This research focused on the design and development of a seasoned sour tamarind cube forming machine for tamarind producers in Phetchabun Province.
"The machine consisted of a molding handle, a spring molding handle, and a base."
The size of the machine size was 200 x 305 x 386 mm.
The results showed that relevant experts were satisfied with the design and development of the machine.
The production speed of the machine could be increased by 1.8 times or 83.3% compared with the original machine.
"The average size change of the tamarind cube after molding was 102.8%, the length was reduced by 95.1%, and the height increased by 102.8%."
The average forming force was of about 3.6 N. The development of the machine also improved the convenience of the packaging process.
"The formed tamarind cube was square and not loosen; therefore, the packaging was convenient and beautiful."
