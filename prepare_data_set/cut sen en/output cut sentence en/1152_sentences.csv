The purpose of the research is to study the cleaning and separation of coal powder in circulation flotation column.
"The lignite coal from Mae Moh Mine with sizing smaller than 250 microns was studied and then cleaned and separated coal powder using the microbubbles, which generated by ejector nozzle."
The average microbubble size was about 54-57 microns.
"In the cleaning process for coal powder, small air bubbles can catch the coal powder and float to the water surface in the column."
"When compared to the coal powder before washing, the amount of ash can be decrease about 20.5% and the heating value of coal can be increased to 21.7%."
