This research presents the developments of a solar power system measurement system for research studies using the NETPIE platform.
"In addition, there is the application of Internet of Things technology (IoT) to measurement and display systems for research studies related to solar power generation systems for the convenience of research studies."
"A work process is a group of electrical measurement circuits with two sets of voltage, current, solar panel temperature, and environmental sensors such as solar radiation, ambient light, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity."
"Signals are sent to two NodeMCU ESP32 processor boards, communicated via NETPIE cloud servers with MQTT protocol, the measurement systems can be displayed on a computer laptop or smartphone both on-site and remotely."
"The result of the evaluation test revealed that the proposed measurement system has an all-day Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 3%, which can be effectively used in a research study on the performance of solar power generation systems."
