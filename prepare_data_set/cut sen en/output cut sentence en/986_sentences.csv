The purpose of this research is to study the preliminary information and find ways to improve and increase efficiency in the mixed soil filling process of a compound clay manufacturer.
"By using the Multiple Activity Chart as a starting tool, operating data of a case company were recorded, analyzed, and identified improvement solutions with focus on waste reduction under ECRS principle."
Results were then evaluated and compared between pre and post implementation.
We found that there were two problems associated with the filling process: 1) Machine and employee idle time 2) Machine efficiency is not performed at its best.
"With ECRS guidelines, we conducted three improvement approaches: 1) Combined operating procedures and working areas together."
2) Rearranged sequences of mixed soil packaging process for both machines and employees.
and 3) Simplified working procedures by taking off steel beams in positions that obstructed employee movement.
The improvement results showed that the time spent filling per bag was reduced by 53.00%.
The percentage of machine efficiency increased by 89.58%.
Work rate of the 1st and 2nd employees went up 26.94% and 43.86% respectively.
"As a result, the overall process productivity increased 105.88% and the company could save labor expenses by 19,320 Baht per year."
