"Nowadays, most of the electricity is produced from petroleum, and coal."
These fuels aredepletable and produce toxic to the environment.
"In addition, the electricity demand is increasing.Many researches have been focusing in energy management."
Load profile clustering is one ofthe energy management tools.
"In this paper, one of the most efficient clustering method, ParticleSwarm Optimization Clustering (PSOC), was firstly explored in load profile clustering."
The resultswere compared to the K-mean clustering which was a widely used method.
It is a standard dataclustering method.
There were total of 482 load profiles.
Each load profile was energy consumptionrecorded every 15 minutes for a 24-hour period.
"Therefore, there were total of 96 points in oneload profile."
The load profiles were cleansed and normalized.
"Then, they were clustered by particleswarm optimization and K-means clustering methods."
The best number of groups was identifiedusing the Knee method.
"The results could be concluded that the particle swarm optimizationclustering method provided a better result than the K-means clustering method, and the particleswarm optimization clustering method converged faster than K-means clustering method."
