The objective of this research study of the gauge pressure control that affects working of automatic water pump system with steam at atmospheric Gauge pressure 0 kPa and 10 kPa for condenser tank at suction head 2 m within 10 hr.
Control by opening-closing the valve by using programmable logic control (PLC).
From comparing temperature and gauge pressure inside the steam tank and two condenser tanks came to the analysis and found that three systems can work continuously automatically by alternating the condenser tank between tank A and tank B.
By controlling the pressure of the condenser tank at 10 kPa the number of pumping cycles and the pumped water increased by an average of 33% and 31% respectively.
"The max daily number of pump cycles was 16 cycles and max pumped water is roughly 3,006 L. The duration of the rise of the temperature inside the condenser tank from the ambient temperature to the boiling point of water at controlled gauge pressure."
When the pressure rises the temperature rises accordingly.
"Therefore, the heating time of the condenser tank is reduced and the system can be operated quickly."
The number of work cycles within 10 hr has therefore increased and the number of duty cycles increases the pumped water increases accordingly.
