"In this study, the TiO2-C nanocomposites were synthesized by simple mixing method with glucose that was used as precursor."
"The TiO2 P25 (Degussa) powders were mixed with glucose in various volume ratios (1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5) without the reaction."
The calcination process was operated at the temperature in ranging between 300-500oC.
"Moreover, the specific surface area and components of the samples were analyzed by BET and TGA techniques, respectively."
"The results found that the TiO2-C at the volume ratio of 1:2.5 and the calcination temperature of 400oC displayed highest specific surface area as about 122.08 m2/g, which showed higher than TiO2 P25 (Degussa) standard around 130.33% and found TiO2 contents in catalyst over 70%."
