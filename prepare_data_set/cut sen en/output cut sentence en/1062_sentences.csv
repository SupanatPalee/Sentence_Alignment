The objective of this research aimed to solve scheduling problem for a Truck Part Production Company in Phitsanulok province using Mathematical Programming Model in order to minimize makespan.
"The data on purchasing from the customers, product and machine, and all related constraints were collected and generated to be datasets for this case study.Then, a Mathematical Programming Model for the datasets was developed before adopting Solver program, which is an add-in option provided for Microsoft Excel to find the optimal production schedule."
The experimental results indicated that the proposed model can be applied to construct the optimal production schedule for all of the datasets within acceptable execution time.
The optimal schedules also reduced the number of unnecessary machine usage by 29% in some datasets.
"Moreover, the makespan obtained from the optimal production schedule for this case study of this company was 4,678.90 minutes."
This is better than the makespan of the current production schedule by 36.48%.
