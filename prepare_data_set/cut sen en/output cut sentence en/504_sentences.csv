This research presents the method of using the Volterra series for MDOF nonlinear system.
It is displayed in the form of a matrix to simplify the presentation.
To achieve an understanding of the use Volterra series with MDOF nonlinear system.
Volterra series is applied to the two degrees of freedom nonlinear system in single input multi output (SIMO).
The calculated first and second-order transfer functions are presented as graphs.
The graphs of the second-order transfer functions are presented at frequency  .
It can be seen the subharmonic frequency is half of the fundamental frequency.
The graphs of the third order transfer functions are presented at a diagonal line at .
"From the graph, it can be seen the subharmonic frequency is lower than the fundamental frequency, which is one-third of the fundamental frequency, and it is found that some frequencies interfere with the fundamental frequency."
This kind of frequency cannot be seen in the first-order transfer function.
"In practice, this subharmonic frequency may appear in the transfer function obtained from the signal measurement."
