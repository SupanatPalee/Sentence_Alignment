Straw shredded rice straw and postharvest rice straw are postharvest technologies for reducing the physical size of straw and rice stubble to an average length of 50-100 millimeters.
"This helps to reduce the barriers to soil tillering, decomposing into organic matter faster, contributing to nutrient turnover in the soil."
The cutter head design for cutting straw and rice stubble is a Cylinder Type work in the style of chop and direct throw.
"The axle of the blade is 38 mm long, 600 mm diameter steel blade."
"The blade is made of steel, 32 mm wide, 136 mm long, 3mm thick, 4 units."
"Serves as a cutter, straw and rice stubble with a maximum speed of 1,800 rpm."
"Performance tests were performed at different speeds at 68, 84 and 102 rpm with varying input straws at 3, 5 and 8 kg.The average length of cuttings was 2-5 cm, average 2.4 kg / min."
"80% of the input straw The average length is 5-6 cm, average 4.4 kg / min."
88 percent of the input straw.
The average length is 8-10 cm.
The average volume is 7.5 kg / min.
93% of the input straw intake.
