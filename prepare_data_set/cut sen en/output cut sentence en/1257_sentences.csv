"Nowadays, there are lots of underground construction project in Thailand such as subway construction, underground parking building and culvert."
Retaining wall is the most crucial part for underground construction project because excavation level for these underground structures is very deep below ground surface.
The purpose of this research is to proposed a prediction equations for construction time of diaphragm wall drilled by cable mechanical hang grab.
The proposed equation was validated by the mearing data from MRT Orange Line at Rajamangala Station.
"Construction time of diaphragm wall can be divided into two parts, which are the time of excavation process, Texcand the construction time (after excavation finished), Â Taf."
"This research indicated that there are many variables factors affect to the construction time such as size of diaphragm wall, Texc- Vexc relationship and the tine of construction process."
From the Texc- Vexc relationship was found that the sand layer is more difficult excavation than clay layer.
"Moreover, the proposed a prediction equation can help contractors to plan the construction schedule correctly."
