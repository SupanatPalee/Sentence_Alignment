Time delay is a very frequent phenomenon and is almost associated with nearly all constructing projects.
"Every construction project tries to mitigate the delay of its project by applied the management strategies and planning theories, but the construction delay still happens."
This study investigated the causes of delay in large building construction projects which located at Nakhon Phanom province.
The likelihood level and the impact level were considered then presented on the risk map.
Eighteen causes of construction delay are proposed which based on literature reviews.
The results shown that the structural work was the most influence work on the project delay time.
The 18 delay causes in structural work were grouped into 2 groups of delay risk.
"One group was the medium-high risk cause, and the another was medium risk cause."
The first five causes that occupied the highest importance indices and were grouped in the medium-high risk are identified.
"As the results, four of them came from non-excusable delay cause and the rest was excusable and compensable delay cause."
"Moreover, D15: Unappropriated planning and coordinating cause occupied the highest importance index which is non-excusable delay cause."
The research outcomes can help project managements to control projects by focus on the delay causes that were grouped in the medium-high risk.
