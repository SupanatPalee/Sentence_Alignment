This research aimed to study the potential of ethanol and biogas production from oil palm frond juice (OPFJ) and oil palm trunk juice (OPTJ) performed using S. cerevisiae for alternative energy.
The amount of glucose consumed quickly to produce ethanol in 48 hrs.
"The amount of glucose in OPFJ decreased from 31.26 to 5.09 g/l, and OPTJ decreased from 58.65 to 4.95 g/l."
The amount of glucose consumed to produce ethanol until steady-state at 96 hours of fermentation processes.
"The highest ethanol yield from OPTJ and OPFJ was 31.28 and 11.50 g/l, respectively."
The calculation of ethanol yield found that the ethanol yield from OPTJ was higher than that of OPFJ.
"The ethanol yield of OPTJ was 0.48. g-ethanol/g-glucose, while OPFJ was only 0.39 g-ethanol /g-glucose due to fermentation efficiency."
"The fermentation efficiency of OPTJ was as high as 93.42%, while the fermentation efficiency of OPFJ was only 72.14%."
Biogas production from distillery slop of OPFJ and OPTJ used the biochemical methane potential (BMP) technique.
"The maximum accumulated methane production of OPFJ and OPTJ were 997 and 1,068 ml at 71.53 and 71.18% of methane composition, which were very similar."
Corresponding to methane yield (Yield) was equal to 314 and 336 ml CH4/g VS.
The experimental results showed that OPFJ and OPTJ of distillery slop have the potential to be used as raw materials for biogas production.
"Three Genera of archaea dominant founding were Methanobacterium sp., Methanofollis sp., and Methanosaeta sp."
