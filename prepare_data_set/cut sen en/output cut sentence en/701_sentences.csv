A mathematical phantom is a simple method to simulate the organs of the human body.
"A phantom can simulate organs such as the chest, lung, bone, and muscle."
The information for this phantom was gained from real organs captured by computed tomography (CT) images.
The purpose of this study was to create a human thoracic phantom.
The image data of the simulation phantom images was compared to CT images from the database: Radiopedia.
Thirty-four slices of CT images were referenced.
The simulated organs were similar to the organs in the CT images.
The line profiles and the intensity value of the simulated images and the reference images were compared.
"The qualitative evaluation of profile and intensity value and intensity value of lungs, heart and bone were not significantly different (P<0.050)."
The intensity of blood vessels was significantly different (P>0.05).
The assessment of three experts in human anatomy on the simulated image and the database image were moderately similar.
"In conclusion, the phantom simulation images were similar to CT images from the database."
"Therefore, the phantom may be used to test algorithms in medical image processing."
