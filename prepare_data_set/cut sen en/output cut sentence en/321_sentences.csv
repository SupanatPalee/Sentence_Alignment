"This paper proposes a working condition monitoring system for a split type air conditioner that consists of embedded systems for measuring compressor current, indoor and outdoor temperatures."
These data were used in a classification process.
"While the air conditioner is working in normal condition, the compressor current, indoor and outdoor temperatures were recorded as databases."
The indoor and outdoor temperatures at the present time were used to select the average reference compressor current for comparing with the average compressor current at the present time.
The obtained result of these processes is the working conditioning of the air conditioner.
"For the experiments, the 36,000 BTU of the split type air conditioner was used."
The experiments were set up in three cases; condenser and cooling coil were dirty and refrigerants were lower than normal conditions.
The experimental results showed that the presented system could correctly indicate the working conditioning of the split type air conditioner.
