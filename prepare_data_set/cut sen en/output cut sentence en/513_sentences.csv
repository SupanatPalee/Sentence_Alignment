"In this study, traffic micro-simulation model was applied to test the concept of road network design and performance analysis in the faculty of engineering, Khon Kaen university and surrounding areas in conditions before and after improving the traffic management."
The results of the study showed that the new network reducing traffic volumes that are not related to the faculty of engineering to switch to the route along the main road network of the university.
"At the same time, the driving speed in the area of the faculty of engineering decreased by 25.52%."
"According to the results, the analysis supports the suitability of the concept of the new road network, which is in line with the principles of designing techniques to change the route, traffic clamming, living and sustainable community design concept and in accordance with the development plan of the faculty of engineering as well."
