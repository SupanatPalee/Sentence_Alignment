The study aims to increase the efficiency of the production process of a 9 Joom Gong.
The Flow Process Chart shows the duration and distance of each activity.
"The gong process has 29 activities and the Why-Why analysis shows the relationship between the problem and all possible causes, Including wastes analysis (7 wastes)."
We found that there were too many problems with the process.
It was too complicated and time consuming to cut the gong.
The team used the technique to improve the work (ECRS) to design solutions.
It is a process of measuring the circumference of the face plate.
It's a step with too much work so we simplified the workflow.
We used mathematical formulas to calculate the length of the circle.
"Then, a standard plate was defined to determine the girth length of each gong, respectively."
It was found that the efficiency of work increased by 100%.
Part of the process of measuring the size of the steel bar was a complicated way to work.
Apply the principle of multiple parts together (Combine).
We set the color bar size of each gong size to the standard steel plate size.
In order to use it as a guideline to draw the edge of the gong.
It reduced our work time by 57.68%.
The cutting edge steel plate was a step that used both time and movement to cut too many gong edges.
It was improved by using simpler working principle (Simplify).
We created the device to help in the work.
After modification it reduced the work time by 48.42%.
"By improving the 3-steps process in the production, waste could be reduced and productivity increased by 41.46% Keywords 9 Joom Gong; efficiency; waste"
