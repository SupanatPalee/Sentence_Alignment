This study analyzes the material removal rate (MRR) and the workpiece surface quality (Ra) of the electric arc milling process on SKD 11 grade steel (SKD 11) by using Taguchi L18 orthogonal arrays and Grey relational analysis.
"There are 3 experimental factors including the efficiency factors, the current and the wire speed."
The Experiment is measured by material removal rate and the surface roughness of the workpiece after wire electrical discharge process.
"The result is the optimal factor of machine cutting for SKD11 steel, which is determined following the conditions of grey relational analysis and then can be increased 180.18% in removal rate and decreased 97.86% in surface smoothness."
A comparison is to the Taguchi method.
It is found that the Grey relational analysis is demonstrated to be an appropriate method for determining the experimental factors.
