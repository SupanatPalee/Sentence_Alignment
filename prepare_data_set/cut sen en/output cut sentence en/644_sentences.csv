This paper proposes stability analysis of AC-DC power system feeding paralleled controlled buck-converter.
"Normally, a controlled buck-converter behaves as a constant power load, that can affect the stability of system."
"Therefore, stability analysis is very important."
"In this paper, the proposed mathematical model is used with the Middlebrook’s criterion to predict the unstable point."
The results are validated by the well-known Eigenvalue’s theorem and the simulation.
Good agreement between the theory and simulation is achieved.
