This research has developed a deep learning system for blurring images of inappropriate behavior.
"Blurring inappropriate images can be challenging for employees, as these pictures and clips are often widely published."
"Therefore, this paper presents a system that consists of three steps: training deep learning, detecting inappropriate behavior, and blurring the detected regions."
The first step involves training the deep learning system using the Mask R-CNN model.
"In the second step, inappropriate behavior is detected using Mask R-CNN."
"Finally, in the last step, the detected regions are blurred using a Gaussian filter."
"The results of the evaluation showed that the system's performance in blurring images was assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score, calculated from the Confusion Matrix."
"The metrics for the blurred images were found to be 0.72, 0.8, 0.86, and 0.83, respectively."
"For videos, the metrics were 0.88, 0.93, 0.92, and 0.93, respectively."
