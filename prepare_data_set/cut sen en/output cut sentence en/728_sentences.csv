"In the past, coal conversion was often seen as pollution that affected people's health and environment."
"Nowadays, clean coal technology is getting enhanced and accepted."
The major benefit of coal is found around the world and has high heating value for low-cost fuel.
"When compared with biomass fuel, combustion operation of coal is easier and more stable, as well as has small effect on combustion equipment."
The cost of coal is more consistent as compared to other fossil fuels.
"So, coal is the main fuel used for power plant in many countries."
"For coal harvesting, surface mining is applied for shallow coal seam while underground mining is adopted for depth coal seam."
"For the case of very depth coal seam, which is unworthy for applying underground mining, Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) technology can be applied by injecting gasification agent into underground coal seam for generating gasification process."
"Then, syngas from the gasification process supplies to the surface for beneficial usage."
"In this article, UCG technology and its research were reviewed."
General gasification was firstly introduced.
"The, UCG technology were reported, and UCG research was reviewed."
"Finally, practical use of UCG technology in coal mining was mentioned, and potential of applying UCG in Thailand was reported."
