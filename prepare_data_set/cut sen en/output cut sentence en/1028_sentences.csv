"The aim of this research is to study physical characteristics of banana leaf containers after 75 ̊C, 85 ̊C, and 95 ̊C hot extrusion, for 1, 3 and 5 minutes, respectively, by using a cup-shape mold with 7.6 mm inner diameter and 3 cm depth through hydraulic compression."
"The number of banana leaf layers used in the hot extrusion are two, three, and four, respectively."
"To analyze the molded containers, the shape and the strength of each container are compared."
"From the experiment, it is found that by increasing temperature of the extrusion, the shape of the container is as nearly beautiful as the shape of its mold."
This is because the heat of the mold makes the banana leaves softer and easier to be formed.
"Likewise, by increasing extrusion time, there is more time for the leaves to shape its form, and this makes the shape of the container beautiful."
Adding banana layers also increases the strength of the container because the additional thickness is directly proportional to the strength of the container.
"In the future, this research will be developed to be more suitable for commercial applications"
