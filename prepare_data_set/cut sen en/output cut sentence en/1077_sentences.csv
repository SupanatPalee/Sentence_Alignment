"Nowadays, inventory management plays an important role in the success and sustainability of                 a business."
"Moreover, the current demand and price of steel fluctuate significantly."
"As a result, the objective of this research is to propose inventory management based on the sales forecast of the steel wire mesh."
"It performed predictions using three methods: Holt-Winters, Random Forest, and XGBoost."
"The data were divided into a train set and a test set, with two ratios."
"From the comparison, it was found that the Random Forest method yielded the highest forecast accuracy at a ratio of 90:10 with a mean absolute percentage error of 4.50."
"After obtaining an accurate forecast model, the research incorporated demand data into mathematical models to plan inventory policies (Q, r) and determine raw material purchasing policies."
It determined the most economical order quantity and re-ordering points for the minimum inventory management costs.
The results from the mathematical model revealed that it is possible to reduce the overall cost of factory operations in inventory management planning by up to 4.75% and the costs obtained from the forecast data were close to the actual data values.
