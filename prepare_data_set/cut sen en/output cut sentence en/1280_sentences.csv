"In this study, were investigated the leaf stalk and leaf of the Elephant ear plant as an adsorbent for the removal of Lead (Pb(II)) from synthesis wastewater."
"The adsorption factors studied were the contact time, initial M(II) concentration and pH."
"Moreover, we studied adsorption in isotherm, comparison of Langmuir isotherm and Foundlish isotherm."
The adsorption efficiency in 9.619 ppm Pb(II) were found that leaf stalk (90.72 %) > leaf (79.27%) The Qe (mg/g) were increase with increasing initial Pb(II) concentration.
The adsorbent from this work could adsorb Pb(II) which shound be of interest in application such as wastewater treatment.
