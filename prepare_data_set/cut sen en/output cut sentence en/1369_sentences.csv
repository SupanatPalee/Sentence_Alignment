This paper presents the low cost soil moisture measurement using non-inverting amplifier in order to amplifier the small signal input that is the pre-processing part of embedded board.
The non-inverting amplifier is applied for the small measured signal from soil to improve the input for embedded system.
"Arduino UNO board, Atmega328 microcontroller and the analog to digital converter (ADC) module are used to process the signal."
Experiments show the proposed measurement in comparison with the 3-in-1 digital soil moisture meter and YY-1000 hand moisture meter outdoors.
Empirical results show insignificantly compared with the commercial meters.
