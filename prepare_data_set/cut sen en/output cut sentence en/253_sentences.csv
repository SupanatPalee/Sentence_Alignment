This research aims to study and find out an appropriate parameter for compress rubber screen machine set up by using experimental design.
"The process of compress rubber screen faced with waste product occurrence during operation, and unable to produce in time of customers’ need because of unable to set up an appropriate parameter for compress rubber screen machine setup."
"According to analysis for the cause of the problems, it was found that the error was caused by three main factors which affected in common on the production process, those were first press period, second press period, and motor speed round."
Then the researcher designed the Full-factorial experiment by studying factors at two levels on Minitab version 17 program.
The results revealed that the first press period commonly affected the most on the result of the experiment.
"The results from the program showed an appropriate setup: the first press period setup at 12 millimeters, the second press period setup at 11 millimeters, and the motor speed round setup at 120 rounds per minute."
"According to the utilization of parameter setup value from the experiment, it was found that time in the compress rubber screen process was reduced by 60% and also reduced waste occurrence by 30%."
"These can be calculated of capital reduction at 9,580 baht per month, or 114,960 baht per year."
