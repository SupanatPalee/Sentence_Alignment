Gas-solid two-phase flow is the main phenomena in the fluidized bed system.
This paper presents a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD–DEM) approach to simulate the behavior of fluid–particle interaction in a continuous fluidized bed dryer.
"DEM is employed to model the granular particle system, whilst the CFD is used to simulate the fluid flow by solving the locally averaged Navier–Stokes equation."
"Influence of the superficial gas velocity, mass flow rate, particle temperature and residence time of solid particles on the drying process have been reported."
The prediction of residence time can help to optimize continuously operated fluidized process.
