This research presents a method for eliminating salt and pepper noise using a deep learning system.
The method consists of two steps.
"In the first step, deep learning systems are trained to identify the noise densities."
The second step involves improving the AWMF method (Adaptive Weighted Median Filter) to remove the noise.
"The deep learning system is adapted to define the sub-window size, which is used in the restoring process."
The experimental results demonstrate that the improved AWMF method outperforms the state-of-the-art method at high noise densities and requires less processing time.
