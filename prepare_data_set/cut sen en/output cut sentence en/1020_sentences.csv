"This research is to study the income increase of giant sour tamarind farmers through the process of solar dryer academic service at Wang Nok Aen Subdistrict, Wang Thong District, Phitsanulok Province (Longitude: 16º50’32” N Latitude: 100º41’12” E)."
The study divided the objectives into two parts: Part (1) feasibility study of the application of solar dryer for drying giant tamarind.
"In this process, the drying characteristic of the solar dryer is known, for example, the temperature it can achieve (maximum, minimum, and average temperature)."
It will also tell you how long it will take for drying to reach its final weight (ready weight).
It must be only about 50% of the initial weight.
The results showed that the solar dryer was designed and built.
"It will be able to achieve a maximum and minimum temperature in the dryer of about 73.6 ºC and 46.3 ºC, respectively, with the average temperature at which the dryer is approximately 59.3 ºC."
"In the part of the drying time, the final weight of the ready-to-sell product is 50% of the initial weight."
It is approximately 5 hours (which takes less time than conventional drying using the patio drying method which used 2 days or 18 hours).
"Part (2), to study the possibility of increasing the income of giant tamarind farmers from using solar dryers."
The results showed that two solar dryers were given to farmers groups through the academic service process.
"It will be able to dry giant tamarind in the amount of 1,800 kg (wet weight) or 900 kg (dry weight) per production cycle in 1 year."
"When the dried giant tamarind is sold, it will increase the farmers’ income by about 225,000 baht per year or accounted for an increase in revenue compared to the case of distribution of frozen giant tamarind with a selling price of approximately 100 baht/kg, at 45,000 baht per year."
"In addition, if the farmer's group has improvements in the packaging, it will increase the opportunity to increase their income."
