This research developed a smart farm system for aquatic pond in area of Kalasin province.
"The system consists of a water quality measuring device with sensors that can detect temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen attributes in the water."
One can switch on/off the water machine using the technology of IoT that can be accessed and transmitted to the device via the internet.
"And also, there is a web application that one can retrieve data anytime from anywhere either on the mobile’s screen or computer’s screen."
The system was developed according to the intelligent technology guidelines by applying knowledge from experts to create a warning when the water quality is at risk.
"As the result of this development, the accuracy of the sensoring equipment used to measure water quality was tested."
"Moreover, using a system that can display and collect data help to reduce the work time by 31.64 percent per month"
