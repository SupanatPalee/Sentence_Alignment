This research aimed to study the reuse of aluminum electrode in electrocoagulation process for wastewater treatment from indigo dyeing process.
The experiments were conducted both in laboratory scale and small industry.
An aluminum sheet thickness of 0.5 mm was used as electrodes in electrocoagulation process.
"Moreover, the cost of wastewater treatment was also studied."
"The conditions for electrocoagulation process were set as follow; electrolysis time of 60 minutes, current density of 300 A/m2, and initial pH of 11 or without adjustment when the experiments were conducted in prototype reactor."
"At the laboratory scale experiments, it was found that 3-times reuse could maintain the rectangular shape of anode electrodes as the shape of cathode."
"The prototype reactor for wastewater treatment from real indigo dyeing in a small industry, the efficiency of the 9-liters prototype reactor presented COD and color removal of 76.75% and 76.39% respectively."
"For 3-times reuse of anode electrode, it was costly 1,426.22 bath per cubic meter."
"Moreover, if the reuse of electrode was repeated until the anode was dissolved completely, the cost of treatment was about 169.59 bath per cubic meter."
