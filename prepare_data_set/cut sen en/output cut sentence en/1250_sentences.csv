One of the weaknesses of road construction management is the lack of maintenance management.
"In this case study, it is found that when the machinery used in road construction had a chronic abnormality and there was no correction, therefore, causing more damage until unable to work."
"When analyzing the causes of weakness in maintenance management, there were three main causes; (1) lack of maintenance management at the operational, (2) lack of good attitude towards maintenance, and (3) lack of maintenance reporting system."
"This research, therefore, applied the autonomous maintenance and maintenance reporting systems as well as the participatory approach to enhance cooperation, build knowledge and positive attitude towards maintenance work."
"During the research process, the reporting system was implemented to continuously monitor weekly changes."
"After one year and six months, it was found that operational staff had a positive attitude towards maintenance, resulting in the number of machine failures that had to be stopped for more than three days was reduced by an average of 52%, availability had increased by an average of 29%."
"In addition, repairing costs were reduced by 86%."
