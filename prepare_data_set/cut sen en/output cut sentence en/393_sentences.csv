"In this research, chemical precipitation was studied using 4 types of shells as chemical precipitants, as follows, oyster shells, Mussel shells, Cockle shell and striped shells."
The efficiency of heavy metal removal (lead and copper) contaminated in synthetic wastewater was studied by shells prepared at 200 and 900 ºC temperatures.
Better than shells baked at 200 ºC with a maximum efficiency of 100 % heavy metal removal.
And it was found that striped shells removed the most lead.
"Accounted for 50.07 %, followed by cockle shells oyster shells and mussel shells accounted for 49.15 %, 48.44 % and 43.83 %, respectively."
"In addition, this study compared the removal effect of lead and copper at pH 5, 7, 9 and 11."
It was found that the optimum condition for lead and copper removal was pH 9 by all kinds of shells the highest lead removal efficiency is between 86 - 90% and the highest copper removal efficiency is 90%.
