The objective of this research was to design and set up a Robot arm to picked up the material from the automatic sorting machine with conveyor belt.
This journal paper focused on designing the model of Robot Arm in Pneumatics drive system and control system through the programmable logic controller (PLC).
The development a machine can be also used as basis automatic control system in engineering.
"From the result, it can be shown that the automatic sorting machine with conveyor belt classified the materials as size 50×50×50 mm and size 50×50×30 mm with high accuracy."
"Robot arm holds objects with a maximum weight of 1,800 grams and a cross-sectional area starting at 45 mm or more."
Average time of the test objects was 19.30 seconds.
