"This paper proposes aÂ  methodology of machining center selection, which is based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach."
This research aims to study the weight of decision criteria to select the factors of machining center by using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process.
"The seven main criteria of machining center, which are capacity, space, maintenance, safety, reliability, cost and precision, are considered."
The result shows that the most important factor is the capacity of the machining center.
The advantage of the research is to provide information to the manufacturing department in the decision to install the machining center.
