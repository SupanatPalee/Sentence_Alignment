This paper presents a mathematical model of system with constant power loads.
These are speed controlled permanent magnet synchronous motor drive and output voltage controlled buck converter.
The considered CPLs are feeded by a three phase rectifier via the DC-link filters.
The DQ method and the generalized state-space averaging method (GSSA)Â  are used to derive the dynamic model to achieve the time invariant model.
The proposed model is suitable for the stability analysis due to CPL.
The simulation via the exact topological model of MATLAB is used to validate the proposed model.
The results show that a good agreement between the derived model and the exact topological model can be achieved.
