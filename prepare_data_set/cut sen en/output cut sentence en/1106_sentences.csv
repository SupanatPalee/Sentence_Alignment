The purposes of this research were to design and develop a radio-controlled lawnmower including testing the competency of a radio-controlled lawnmower.
"The result of designing and developing a radio-controlled lawnmower by a prototype radio-control which consists of a lawnmower structure, wheels, gear motor, control circuit, and battery."
"The result of testing the competency of a radio-controlled lawnmower by using three-level of grass height which are 6, 9, and 12 cm said that a lawnmower was working with its highest efficiency with 6 cm grass."
The competency of a lawnmower when used to cut 9 and 12 cm grass are respectively lower because of the increase of grass height.
The moving speed average is 1.00±0.41 m/s.
The competency average is 1.00 ±0.47 rai/hr.
The efficiency average is 94.63 ±1.33%.
The fuel waste average is 1.60 ±0.65 L/rai.
The electric power waste average is 0.16 ±0.15 kW.hr.
The loss after cutting the average is 5.37±1.52% and 100% of the cut off average.
