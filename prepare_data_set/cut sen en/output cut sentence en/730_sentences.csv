The objective of this study was to develop the model of recirculation completely-mixed stirred tank areal reactor (RCSTAR) of recirculation surface flow constructed wetland (RSFCW) using granular activated carbon (GAC) as a media contained in 29 pots of reed.
"The ratio of width to: length was <1:4, used travel area was 0.50 m2, and the initial height of bed 20 cm."
The result of the study found that the recirculation ratio: QR/Qin (R) was 3.
The hydraulic recirculation time (HReT) was 2 hrs for treat washing waste water.
"As a result, the efficiency of COD and BOD removal was 90.19% and 87.50%, respectively which cause the second-order-reaction with areal rate coefficient (kA2nd) equals 0.158 and 0.223 m/day, respectively."
