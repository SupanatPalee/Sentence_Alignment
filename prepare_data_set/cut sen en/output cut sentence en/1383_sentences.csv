Several motors are currently being put to use in a wide variety of industrial machines.
The motor will be utilized continuously for a long period of time and will also be used continuously.
"Motors that are used continuously will gradually lose some of their efficiency, and there is also a danger that they will be damaged as a result of being operated, which would disrupt the production process."
"As a result, one possible solution is to create a tool that can evaluate the performance of the motor."
"By measuring the current passing through each phase of the motor, one may determine the state of the motor and conduct an investigation into its cause."
"This is a necessary step in the maintenance plan, which also includes reducing the impact on the production process to the maximum extent possible."
"According to the results of the research, the equipment that is used to assess the performance of the motor can operate within the following range: It can measure the current in a variety of ranges, display the data, and send it to be checked wirelessly."
It can also gather data for analysis with the help of a simple program.
