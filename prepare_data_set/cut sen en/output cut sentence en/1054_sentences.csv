The small PCB punching machine has facilitated the drilling of PCB to be accurate and fast at the position which uses the microcontroller as a control system.
"This research is a study of the movement time of a small PCB punching machine from stepping motor control by a microcontroller with different moving distances: 50 mm, 60 mm, 70 mm, 80 mm, 90 mm and 100 mm."
"In addition, the frequencies at 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 500 Hz were used to control the stepping motor."
It was found that all frequency movements for stepping motor control were linear.
"When the higher frequency was given, it resulted in shorter time for movement."
"However, the slope at 50 Hz, 100 Hz and 500 Hz frequency had different values: 0.1926, 0.0931, and 0.0521, respectively."
