"The purpose of this research was to increase the production efficiency of venetian blinds sheet cutting machine of Sharp Point Co., Ltd. by preventive maintenance planning."
The research was conducted by collecting working data of aluminum venetian blinds sheet cutting machine by using check sheet.
"Analyze the production efficiency of the machine, find the cause of the machine downtime, set the target, plan the maintenance, implement the plan, and measure the production efficiency in 3 areas: (1) Machine maintenance efficiency, including mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and failure rate (FR)."
"(2) Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), namely availability rate (A), performance efficiency (P), and quality rate (Q), and (3) Losses caused by machine downtime."
"The results showed that after implementing the preventive maintenance plan including daily maintenance plans by pre-work inspection and post-work cleaning, weekly maintenance plan by lubrication inspection and operation, and six-month maintenance plan by replacement parts."
"The performance according to the plan found that the production efficiency of the aluminum venetian blinds sheet cutting machine was increased in all 3 aspects, namely, mean time between failures increased by 3,227.50 minutes, mean time to repair was reduced by 7.5 minutes, and failure rate was reduced to 0.000%."
"The machine has an overall equipment effectiveness increase of 12.64%, which is caused by an increase in the availability rate of 2.72%, an increase in performance efficiency of 9.94%, and the quality rate of 0.37%."
"The losses caused by machine downtime decreased by 1,437.33 Baht per month, categorized as direct labor decreased by 226.88 Baht and opportunity cost decreased by 1,210.45 Baht."
