This research investigates factors that affect the germination and growth of microgreens from general cultivation.
"This relies on people to be careers such as fungus and pests, temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, amount of light, water quality, etc."
"For this reason, this research designed and developed an environmental control system for growing microgreens."
"The system is able to control of temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture to be more suitable than conventional cultivation method."
The system consists of white light used during the daytime and 430-630 nm.
LED light used during the night time for 5 hours.
"It was found that the system helps photosynthesis activities in microgreens during the night, causing the microgreens to grow rapidly."
"In addition, the plump stems and more weight than the microgreens cultivated in the conventional way."
"The system can control 6 factors which are light, temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, quality and water temperature."
"In the experiment, the temperature in the system was controlled and must not be above 30 degrees Celsius."
The relative humidity was controlled to be the range from 65 to 90 %RH.
The moisture in the soil was controlled to be moderate (Moist) the water temperature was kept under 28 degrees Celsius.
"To prove the effectiveness of system, we cultivated the wheat, morning glory and sunflower and compared with those cultivated with uncontrolled condition."
It found that the microgreens that are cultivated with the environment control system is better than the conventional cultivation.
They are grown with an average height control system is about 3.2 cm.
longer than the traditional cultivation.
The height of the stems of microgreens are consistent across the tray rather than a conventional cultivation.
"Of all 3 types of microgreens, The result shows that the average weight cultivated using the system is more than the conventional cultivation about 70.51%."
"Moreover, this environment control system can reduce the harvest time for 2-3 days."
