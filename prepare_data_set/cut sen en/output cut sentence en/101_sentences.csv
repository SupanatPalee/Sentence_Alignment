"The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantity of biogas compression and storage, and the amount of heat at the pressure of 4 bars."
"Three experiments were conducted using gas containers of size 4, 6, and 15.8 kg."
Each experiment was triplicated.
"The results showed that the 6 kg gas container had the highest quantity of biogas compression and storage at 12.07 L/min, which was equivalent to 64.21% of the 15.8 kg container."
"The higher and lower heating values of biogas compressed were 33,318.00 and 29,452.22 kJ/kg, respectively."
The container size 15.8 kg had the quantity of biogas compression and storage of 7.35 L/min less than that of the container size 4 and 6 kg.
The lower heating value of biogas was lower than that of LPG by 1.69 times.
This finding indicates that the container size 6 kg was suitable for cooking in the field.
