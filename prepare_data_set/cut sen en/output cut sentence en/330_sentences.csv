Overspeed is one of the main factors contributing to crashes occurred on national highways and rural roads.
Responsible authorities have put their efforts into solving this problem by installing traffic calming devices before entering the community area.
"This paper presents the effectiveness of traffic calming devices, focusing on the overhang sign and optical speed bar (OSB) installed before the urban signalized intersection."
Rural Road No.
SK2031 passing Wat Khow Kloy School was selected as a case study.
"The speeds of passenger cars passing before and after each traffic calming device location were collected, analyzed, and compared."
The results showed that the overhang sign could not significantly reduce vehicle speeds.
"Conversely, the typical OSB and the OSB with red strips could reduce the vehicle speeds significantly."
"However, the intersection may have some effects on the results."
