"The purpose of this research is to design and build a 3-wheel mini truck with 3 seats, powered by electricity from batteries together with solar power whose dimension is 115 x 245 x 160 cm."
"A DC motor with a power of 48 volts, 750 watts and 2900 revolutions per minute is used as the driving power with a 310 Watts 37.6 Volt 8.27 Ampere solar panel connected to the electric source for supplementary to 4 batteries of 12 volts, 45 ampere per hour which are used as a power source for motor control while driving."
"This research was conducted at speeds of 20, 30 and 40 kilometers per hour compared to the driving distance of unloaded vehicles."
"The experiment was divided into 2 parts, and it was found that (1) the distances of electric propulsion from batteries were 86.73, 81.44 and 76.30 km according to the ordinal speeds, respectively."
"After experimenting with electric driving with solar cells, the distances were increased by about 8 to 10 kilometers."
"(2) When the current value of electricity used per distance speed distance was compared with that of using a battery and driven with solar cells, it was found that the current rate was not different at 5, 8 and 14 amperes according to their distance speeds, respectively."
