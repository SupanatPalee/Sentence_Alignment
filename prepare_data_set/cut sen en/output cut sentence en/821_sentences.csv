The aimed of this research was to improvement work method and reduction idle time in Rice cracker product process.
"The preliminary issue of this study found that the problems in packing and weighing procedure were non-valued added activities: over motion, delay and transportation."
An application of the Kaizen concept to minimize losses through the elimination and reduction of non-valued added activity.
The research study carried out analysis into the root cause of the problems seen through use of a Why-Why Analysis.
"Thereafter, improvement the work method using ECRS."
The results obtained from the improvement showed that such losses to decline; a reduction cycle time in packing and weighing procedure from 30.23 minutes per basket to 23.27 minutes per basket as 23.02% and increase productivity from 400 containers per day to 450 containers per day.
