This research proposed distribution of the Temperature profiles in vertical fluidized bed.
The corn drying in fluidized bed used energy recovery from heat pump.
Study focused on the distribution of temperature profiles in fluidized bed.
"Waste energy from the heat pump for recovery heat but the temperature profiles are not constant, due air conditioner control operate on-off of heat pump."
"The temperature profiles are not constant as the heater used thermostat to control, but the recovery heat from the heat pump advantages without cost from the waste energy of air conditioners."
Therefore can be used to corn drying or small seeds.
The experiment group compose 1.
"Air conditioner 18,000 Btu/hr 2."
Blower 1 hp  3.
Fluidized bed and 4.
Damper for control velocity of hot air at inlet bed.
The experiment group reference speed of hot air velocity at inlet bed 7 m/s using energy only from the heat pump.
The drying time was 420 minutes for storage point less than 12% moisture content dry-basis [1].
"The resultant maximum mean temperature occurred DT = 13.42 oC at 10 minutes and after 60 minutes to 420 minutes, the temperature difference is very small, approximately 1-2 oC."
