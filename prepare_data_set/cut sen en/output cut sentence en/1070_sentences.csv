The objectives of this research were to formulate models of energy consumption in transportation and to define the factors that affect the amount of provincial energy consumption in northern region of Thailand.
"Multiple linear regression analysis models and multiple log-linear regression analysis models were applied to develop three transportation energy consumption models; diesel consumption model, petrol consumption model, and LPG consumption model."
"Also, the models were separately developed to investigate the factors affecting the consumption of Diesel, Petrol, and LPG by using previous data in 2018."
"The independent variables include the number of populations, the number of registered vehicles, the number of gas stations, terrain of each province, and gross provincial product."
It was revealed that the result of the multiple linear regression analysis models was more accurate than that of the multiple log-linear analysis regression models.
"The factors that affect the consumption of diesel are gross provincial product, the number of gas stations, and the number of trucks."
"The factors affecting the consumption of petrol are the number of populations, the number of sedans with no more than 7 passengers, and the terrain."
"Finally, the consumption of LPG is affected by the number of gas stations, the number of sedans with no more than 7 passengers, and the terrain."
