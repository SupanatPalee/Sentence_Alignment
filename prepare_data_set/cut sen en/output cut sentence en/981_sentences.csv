The study of community enterprise problems about tamarind sorting indicates that the process of sorting tamarind took labor to operate.
The amount of sorted tamarind is up to 80 kilograms per hour for one worker.
Which are insufficient for demand.
"Furthermore, 5 workers are needed for the one round of the sorting process, and each worker cost 300 baths per day."
Which is causes high production costs in consequence.
"Therefore, the tamarind sorting machine with a conveyor system is invented, using the concept of speed adjustment for the conveyor to control the rapidity of its movement to co-work with the manual process."
"The machine separates the defective tamarind out, before transporting the qualified tamarinds through the conveyor to the sorting worker to make the process more convenient and faster."
This could be increase the production rate and reduce labor costs.
"This research develops the prototype of the tamarind sorting Machine with belt conveyor for the Daungthong Community Enterprise group in Na Chaliang, Nongphai, Phetchabun."
The conveyor supports 150-kilogram weight.
And its speed can be adjusted in 9 levels with the highest speed at level 9.
The most efficient revolution per minute is at level 4 with 40 rpm speed.
The sorting rate is 100 kilograms of tamarind per hour.
And the machine is available for over 8 hours of work time.
The sorting precision rate is at 100%.
"The target audiences are community enterprise groups, locals, students, food processing entrepreneurs, and exporters."
