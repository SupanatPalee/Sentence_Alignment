This paper proposes an application of artificial neural network for Thai sign language recognition using image processing.
A camera takes images of the movement of a personâ€™s hands as Thai sign language for black and white image processing for the input of artificial neural network.
The experiment results show that the average of all the errors in Thai sign language recognition using artificial neural network will not exceed 16%.
