This paper presents an advancement in the acceleration of object rotation direction detection through the implementation of a feature accumulation system derived from the Discriminant Feature Trace Transform (DFTF).
DFTF data will be utilized in conjunction with machine learning to forecast the rotational direction of an object via the DFTF algorithm.
"It was discovered that in relation to the time required to obtain DFTF results, the procedure is intricate and involves multiple processing steps."
"As a result, the objective of the development guidelines that are outlined in this article is to accelerate the quest for solutions and streamline the work process."
Adjusting the dimensions of the image data is the initial step in reducing the quantity of information that must be computed.
"Following this, the procedure for producing data in the trace transform domain was eradicated and substituted with machine learning in order to convert the image data to DFTF format."
It is then incorporated into the standard procedure for calculating the rotation of an object.
The outcomes of experiments conducted in this paper utilizing on Caltech-256 database.
"The suggested method allows for the measurement of data error using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with data errors of 4.09 and 2.2, respectively."
"The optimal running speed per image in this experiment is 0.12 seconds, yielding an average accuracy of 98.7%."
