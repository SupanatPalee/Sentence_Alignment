This research was to develop a coil model of the HDD actuator arm by using finite element software.
"Since the HDD actuator arm model still had a high percentage error of natural frequencies on the coil side, compared with the PSV400 test results."
"Three types of coil models were created by making a solid body coil model made of isotropic material, a solid body coil model made of orthotropic material, and a spring-like coil model made of isotropic material."
"From the research results, the spring-like coil model made of isotropic material, the solid body coil model made of isotropic material and the solid body coil model made of orthotropic material had a similar percentage error of natural frequencies, which are the natural frequencies of these models compared with the natural frequencies from the samples which were tested by the PSV400."
The arm side had a percentage error of natural frequencies of less than 1%.
"On the coil side, the percentage error of natural frequencies was less than 12%."
"However, it took more time to produce the model as well as to process it."
