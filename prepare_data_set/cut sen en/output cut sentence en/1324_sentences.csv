"The injection molding process of plastic part had been used computer-aided design (CAD) to create geometry and shape, and computer-aided engineering (CAE) to analyze the molten plastic flow inside the mold cavity."
The procedure for design and analysis of the injection plastic part had been performed using the interactive or trial and error method to improve the injection mold until the final result had been received and the injection plastic part could be produced completely.
These methods were consumed time for design and analysis.
"Otherwise, the error might be happened by the data transformation between the CAD and plastic injection analysis software."
This research applied the CAD/CAE integration method of the injection molding plastic to design and analyze plastic parts.
The different shape and physical characteristic had been carried out to study and produce.
The injecting plastic parts were used the CAD/CAE integration software to design and analyze injection for rapidly obtaining the injection part and conditions.
"After the plastic parts were produced, it was obtained the good quality and corrected dimension that the average error of 5.02 %."
