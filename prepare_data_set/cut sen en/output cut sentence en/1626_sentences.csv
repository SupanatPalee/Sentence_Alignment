This research aimed to develop potentiometric sensor for silver ion detection based on neutral carrier L1 (chloro-8-[(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-anthraquinone) in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane plasticized with o-NPOE and KTpClPB was used as an ion exchanger.
"The results found that the best performance was observed for the membrane component of 0.35: 0.38: 33.08: 66.19 (L1: KTpClPB: PVC: o-NPOE, %w/w)."
It showed highly selective to silver ion with a complex formation constant (log bILn) between L1 and silver ion of 5.30±0.07.
The polymeric membrane electrode exhibited near theoretical Nernstian slope of 59.50±0.3 mV decade-1 in a linear range from 1x10-5 to 1x10-2 mol L-1 with a limit of detection of 4.47x10-7 mol L-1.
This electrode was used to measure the silver ion in a wide pH range of 4–8.
"Additionally, the fabricated electrode could be used as indicator electrode for potentiometric titration to determine chloride ion in vitamin B1 tablets compared to Mohr's method with no significant difference."
