This research paper presents the design and creation of automatic material separator in conveyor by PLC controlled system (programmable logic controller).
It was applied the knowledge of control system method from automatic transfer and automatic control system method to operate this model.
"It consists of 2 parts, programming software and hardware which the structure of hardware are operates by DC-motor and electro pneumatics system for transfers and selects type of material to the correct position."
Its efficiency can find from the selected type error of material.
The model worked well under most conditions and the capability of the model was at 97 % accuracy.
