This paper presents a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system.
The considered system consists of a PV panel connected to a buck converter and a battery used as energy storage.
The MPPT commonly used perturb and observe (P&O) method because the control is simple.
The efficiency of the P&O MPPT method depends on the appropriate step size of control signal.
The duty cycle rate of change () was used as a step size of control signal.
"Fuzzy logic control (FLC) can be used for non-linear tasks, resulting in a wide variety of applications."
"In this paper, FLC is used to determine the  to optimize to increase the control efficiency."
"The proposed MPPT method performance is proven by using MATLAB/Simulink, Laboratory prototype and 2.4kW prototype applied to water distribution control house of the university farm, Suranaree University of Technology."
The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPPT method.
The proposed algorithm can provide the faster maximum power convergence and can reduce steady-state power fluctuations better than those of  P&O method.
