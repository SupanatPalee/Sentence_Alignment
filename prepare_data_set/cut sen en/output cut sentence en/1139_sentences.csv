"This paper aims to study the roof type of mushroom house that affects the ventilation of house of Ganoderma lucidum using the Computational Fluid Dynamics to analyze the steady-state flow of temperature distribution and air velocity in 5 types of the house: flat roof, shed roof, butterfly roof, gable roof, and double gable roof."
A mushroom house contains 520 bags.
"The results showed the house with a flat roof, shed roof, butterfly roof, gable roof, and double gable roof, that have average air flow velocity in the house of 4.39x10-9 m/s 5.28x10-11 m/s 9.95x10-8 m/s 3.75x10-10 m/s and 3.66x10-9 m/s, respectively."
"The average temperatures are 302.363 K 302.337 K 302.209 K 302.517 K and 302.015 K, respectively."
