"The article aimed to clarify the influence of major parameters which are jet-to-plate spacings (L/D = 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0) and jet Reynolds numbers (Re = 5000, 10000, 15000 and 20000) on heat transfer enhancement characteristics of impinging jet."
"In the experiments, the heat transfer behaviors were visualized using a thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) sheet coupled with an image processing technical."
"The obtained experimental results revealed that the change of operating condition from L/D = 2.0 and Re = 15000 to L/D = 2.0 and Re = 20000, resulted in the maximum heat transfer enhancement by around 106.5%."
