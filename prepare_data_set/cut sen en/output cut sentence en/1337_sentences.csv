ABSTRACT Series of triaxial cyclic loading tests have been performed to predict the time-dependent deformation of supported pillars in abandoned salt mines planned for a compressed-air energy storage operation.
The salt specimens are prepared to obtain rectangular prisms with nominal dimensions of 54´54´108 mm.
"The applied axial and lateral cyclic stresses depend on mining depths, extraction ratios and injection pressures."
The confining pressures vary from 20% (withdrawal) to 90% (injection) of the in-situ stresses.
The stress conditions are calculated for the depths from 250 to 400 m with extraction ratios ranging from 30 to 60%.
All tests are performed up to 21 days.
Each cycle takes 24 hours.
The steady-state creep strains are calculated in terms of the octahedral shear strains as a function of time.
"The cyclic loading induces a higher creep strain than that of the static loading for all depths and extraction ratios, suggesting that the time-dependent deformations of salt pillars are greater under cyclic loading than under static loading."
The distortional strain energy at failure is used to predict the time-dependent strengths of the salt pillars.
The results suggest that under storage operation the duration under stable condition of the salt pillars decreases with increasing extraction ratios and mining depths.
