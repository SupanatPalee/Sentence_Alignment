This research aims at improving the assembly line balance efficiencies on producing the vehicle’s air outlets in a factory.
"To do so, this research applies a number of assembly line balancing methods on the three production lines which have low balance efficiencies."
This research finally compares the results of those methods in order to find out the most proper method for the vehicle’s air-outlet production lines in the factory.
The most proper method revealed here results in the 13.3% average balance efficiency improvement from the current production.
