The benefits of hydrochloric acid for selective leaching electric arc furnace (EAF) dust has been reported by many authors.
Low concentration hydrochloric acid can extract zinc which presence as the majority element contained in the EAF dust while leaving the iron in the solid residue.
"After extraction, there are also hazardous elements that were leached into an aqueous solution such as lead and chromium."
These two elements could affect the efficient currency in the electrolytic cell on the electrowinning process for zinc separation from the solution.
"Thus, in this study, the cementation process was investigated using zinc powder in order to cement the solute heavy metals in the zinc-rich solution prior to the further process."
"Then optimal conditions were found to be; Zn/Pb 3.0 molar ratio, the temperature at 60oC, and rotation speed at 500 rpm for 10 minutes."
The final solution was very high purity (Pb and Cr concentration < 2 ppm) which was suitable for zinc deposition to produce metallic zinc.
