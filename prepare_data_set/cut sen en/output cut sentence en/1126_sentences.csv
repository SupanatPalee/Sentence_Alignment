This research studied the preparation of carbon-silica composite materials from molasses which is by-product of sugar industry as a carbon source.
"For silica source, conventional chemical tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used and compared with lower cost chemicals i.e."
sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and potassium silicate (K2SiO3).
"Porous properties, moisture content and ash content of the obtained composite materials were characterized using N2 adsorption and ASTM method, respectively."
The surface functional groups were characterized using Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
"The results revealed that all silica sources have led to materials with mesoporous structure and among different silica sources, Na2SiO3 showed the highest surface area of 329 m2/g."
The ash content of composite materials indicated the presence of silica in their structure and the FTIR studies also confirm the carbon and silica groups in the structure.
"It is to be emphasized that molasses, Na2SiO3 and K2SiO3 are suitable materials to produce low cost carbon-silica composite."
