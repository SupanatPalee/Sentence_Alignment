This research aimed to study the characteristics and behavior of adhesion of Gluta Usitata sap on ceramic surface.
"For use in decorating materials on ceramic products, its chemical composition and structure were studied using FTIR (Flourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry) and GC/MS (Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, GC/MS)."
It was found that catechol (C6H4(OH)2) linked with aliphatic molecule in the form of Heptadecenylcatechol compound was a major composition of sap corresponding to thitsiol monomer.
"In addition, water was found to a level of around 40%."
"The physical characteristics of sap in terms of density, viscosity, and hardening time were 0.98 g/cm3, 4,057 mPas, and 14 days respectively."
The wetting and adhesion to ceramic surface between 700 - 1200oC firing temperatures was studied.
It was found that increasing the wetting meant increasing the firing temperature due to lower porosity.
"However, Kerosene was used for reducing the viscosity in the lower contact angle or increasing the wetting using high kerosene content."
The optimum adhesion of sap on ceramic surface was found at 700oC firing temperature compared to the other temperatures with higher porosity and higher adsorption.
