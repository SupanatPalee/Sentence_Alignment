The aim of this research was to study the physical properties of plant pot that was formed with oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber and rubberwood sawdust.
"In this study, the plant pot was designed with 12 cm in diameter, 10 cm in height and 5 mm in thickness."
It had been formed by a hydraulic press at a temperature of 180 Â° C and a pressure of 12.41 MPa for 20 minutes.
"A total of 3 formulas is used, in which the ratio of oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber and rubberwood sawdust consists of 50:50 70:30 and 100: 0."
The results of physical properties showed that all 3 formulas were able to form well.
The best water absorption was 70:30 ratio in 40 minutes.
The most evaporate water was 100: 0 ratio in 144 hours.
"The biological degradation of pots in all 3 conditions, including dry condition, watering every 7 days and watering every day had the same trend."
The highest percentage of degradation was 70:30 ratio.
Planting 3 type plants tests in the pots showed that the swelling of all ratios increased.
"A mixture of oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber and rubberwood sawdust affects the water absorption and biological degradation of pots, in which a higher amount of oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber than rubberwood sawdust is needed."
"Therefore, the 70:30 ratio is suitable for forming plant pots."
