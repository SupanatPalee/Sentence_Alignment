"This research, regarding to the technical to increasing efficiency of the vertical axis wind turbine by using the flywheel energy storage."
The objective was designed and created of the vertical axis wind turbine which were worked together with the flywheel energy storage for the purpose of increased efficiency of the generate electricity.
"By means of using the vertical axis wind turbine for the wind turbine blades driven by lifting force designed, Bangi turbine blade type (Squirrel cage) amount of 8 pieces."
"The size of the flywheel energy storage was diameter 30 cm weight 6 kg with wind speed testing 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 m/second as the respective as the following: The first testing: did not the generator."
The second testing:Â  did the generator.
The third testing: did the generator and the electric load.
"The similitude, both of the wind turbine concluded that the wind turbine which got the flywheel energy storage was the best efficiency of the average 32 %."
