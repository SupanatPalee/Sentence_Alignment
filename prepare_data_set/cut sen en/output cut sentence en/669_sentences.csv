This research aims to study the configuration of grate affect to the behavior of airflow in the high efficiency cooking stove using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
This research defines the model mesh boundary condition from a previous study [11].
"The analysis found that the temperature distribution is consistent with a previous study, by the mean error of 0.77%."
"Then make modify the configuration of grate such as number of holes, thickness and the diameter ratio of hole with different total 27 models to fine the best burning trend, based on the average speed."
"That is at low speed of airflow can improves times to mixing of air and fuel in the combustion chamber, thus burning up as a result and have a good trend of high thermal efficiency."
"From this study found that the best burning trend can be said that the number of grate holes is 44, thickness of grate is 30 mm and the diameter ratio of hole is 13:14 mm."
