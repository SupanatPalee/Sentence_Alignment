This paper investigated the prediction of unconfined compressive strength of soft clay improved with cement and fly ash geopolymer using a multiple linear regression method.
Soft clay (c) was collected at a depth of 5-8 m. from Klong Toey in Bangkok.
Fly ash (FA) was obtained from the Mae Moh power plant in Lampang.
"Factors influencing this study were cement content, Na2SiO3:NaOH ratio, and water content."
The results showed that water content and cement content affect the unconfined compressive strength of the soft clay improved with cement and fly ash geopolymer samples.
The unconfined compressive strength of the samples increased with a decrease in water content and increase in cement content.
"The optimum ingredient of soft clay improved with cement and fly ash geopolymer sample was found at c:binder ratio of 70:30, FA:C ratios between 95:5-70:30, liquid alkaline:binder ratio of 0.6, Na2SiO3:NaOH ratio of 50:50, the concentration of NaOH of 8 molar and water contents of LL, 1.5LL, and 2.0LL."
This equation using the multiple linear regression method is useful for predicting 28-day unconfined compressive strength of soft clay improved with cement and fly ash geopolymer.
