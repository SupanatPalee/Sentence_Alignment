This research work was a study of Lycopene extraction from Gac fruit aril by ultrasonic techniques and using ethanol as extracting solvent.
Para rubber films mixed with the Gac fruit aril extract were prepared by solvent casting method.
The lycopene content in the Gac fruit aril extract was analyzed by HPLC technique.
The Gac fruit aril extract as well as Para rubber films mixed with Gac fruit aril extract were tested for antibacterial activity of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli).
Result from HPLC analysis indicated that maximum lycopene content of 2.2069 mg/g of fresh Gac fruit aril was obtained.
Results from antibacterial test of Gac fruit aril extract showed that the value of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of E. coli were similar and they were equal to 50 mg/mL.
Whereas the MIC value of 12.5 mg/mL and the MBC value of 25 mg/mL were found for S. aureus.
All formulations of Para rubber film mixed with the Gac fruit aril extract could prohibit the growth of S. aureus greater than E. coli.
"Among the 5 formula of Para rubber film, the Para rubber film REGP6 (the 5th formula) illustrated the best antibacterial activity in both E. coli and S. aureus with the average inhibition zone of 0.71 ± 0.51 and 1.74 ± 0.27 mm, respectively."
"Furthermore, Para rubber film REGP6 with 30 days of storage showed a reduction of growth inhibition capability of 57% in S. aureus compared to Para rubber film REGP6 with 1 day of storage."
