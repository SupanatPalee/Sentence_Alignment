The objective of this research was to develop a real-time hydroponics nutrient dissolution measuring system that utilize the electrical conductivity principle to measure the mineral salts dissolved in water.
The measured results will be displayed on the Internet via web interface.
The experimental results indicated that the developed system can provides high precise and accurate reading.
