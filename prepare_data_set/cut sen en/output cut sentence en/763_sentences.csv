Behaviours of reinforced soil are affected by the ultimate tensile strength (Tult) of geogrid and the vertical spacing (Sv) of arrangement.
"Basically, the concept inferred from the current design approach of a reinforced-soil retaining wall shows that, if the Tult-to-Sv (or TVR) ratio is kept the same, the outcoming performance is also the same."
"In this research, a series of triaxial compression tests was performed with sand either unreinforced or reinforced with polypropylene geogrids having four different Tult values."
Number of geogrid layers and Sv were adjusted so as to obtain three different TVR values.
Effects of varying Tult and TVR values were studied by comparing the compressive strength (Rmax) and Poisson’s ratio (nsec) among different geogrid-reinforced sand samples.
"From the results of this study, the followings are found."
"By comparing at the same TVR, the Rmax decreases, while the nsec increases or the lateral deformation increases, with increasing Tult."
This implies that the performance of reinforcing with the geogrids having lower Tult but are closely spaced is better than that of reinforcing with the geogrids having higher Tult but are coarsely spaced.
"On the other hand, when comparing at the same Tult, the Rmax increases, while the nsec decreases, with increasing TVR, because of the increasing of reinforcing density."
"The influences of Tult and TVR on the Rmax and nsec can be explained by the development of deterministic zone resulted from no connection between the geogrid and facing at the end, which negatively affect the transferring of the tensile force mobilised in the geogrid to additional confining pressure to sand."
The objective of this research is to study the surface roughness values obtained by adjusting the parameters of a wire-edged metal cutting machine by using the Taguchi experimental design method to analyze the parameters in cutting influences roughness and the material used in the experiment was SKD 11 mold steel.
The workpiece was cut using the Wire Cutting Machine method.
using electronic wire Brass rod size 0.25 mm.
The workpiece was cut to a thickness of 10 mm.
Experiments were conducted using the Taguchi method of cross-variables according to the experimental table .
For the control factors studied there were 3.
"Factors include voltage, 2."
"IP-on-time electric current (On Time), 3."
Wire speed.
The results of the experiment found that the discharge current There is a significant influence on the surface roughness value for the discharge voltage and feed rate.
"It did not affect the surface roughness in this experiment and the experimental conditions that gave the lowest surface roughness values from this study were the voltage at 50 volts, the IP current value."
"On Time (On Time) at 12 amperes, wire speed at 6 mm./minute, which obtained the best surface roughness value at 3.346 micrometers (μm) from the experiment in increasing the electric current."
A higher charge rate will result in an increase in the formation of a small surface roughness layer.
