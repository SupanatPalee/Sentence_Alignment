The objective of this research is to find the suitable model for estimation of the repair cost for an open type freezer in a convenience store.
The problem encountered is an open type freezer has been repaired and reused a lot with relatively high repair cost and some devices may not be suitable to be repaired and recycled.
The primary factor affecting the price of a freezer repair is the price of      a freezer lifetime and number of times that had been repaired.
Multiple linear regression analysis was used to find a repair evaluation model.
"The study indicated that the suitable model for estimation of the repair cost for an open type freezer consists of           2 independent variables, namely the number of times that has been repaired and lifetime."
"The approximate regression equation to estimation of the repair cost for an open type freezer = 1,425 * the number of times that the repair was done +1,285.2 * lifetime."
The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2Adjusted) is 0.83.
This means that 83% of the variations in the repair cost of an open type freezer are explained by number of times that has been repaired and lifetime.
The evaluation model of the repair cost for an open type freezer can be helped the company to make easier decisions.
