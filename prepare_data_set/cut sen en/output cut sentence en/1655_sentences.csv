"The simple, less time consuming and selective methods for determination of rosmarinic acid content in Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton leaf were developed using TLC-densitometry and TLC-image analysis."
"Additionally, rosmarinic acid as a chemical marker in Perilla frutescens leaf extracts could be used to strengthen the quality of the starting herbal raw materials of Perilla frutescens leaf."
Perilla frutescens leaves were collected from 15 different locations in Thailand.
The analytical separation was performed on the silica gel60 GF254 TLC plate.
Two mobile phases were optimized for this study.
The first one was toluene-chloroform-acetone-formic acid (5:4:1:0.2) and the second one was toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (5:4:1).
"Both quantitative TLC methods to determine rosmarinic acid content in the leaf provided valid specificity, accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision, limit of detection, limit of quantitation and robustness."
Quantitative TLC of rosmarinic acid revealed 2.504 ± 1.631 and 2.485 ± 1.606 g per 100 g of dried leaves by densitometry and image analysis respectively.
TLC-image analysis could be one of alternative methods of rosmarinic acid quantification in Perilla frutescens leaf.
