Precast concrete component production is an important part of off-site construction technology.
The main construction activities are substantially moved to the factory so that the production process and the environment can be managed to achieve higher efficiency.
The design of the production process needs to consider all constraints related to the size and shape of the factory site.
This research was conducted to determine the location of the factory on the land of a participating private company.
"The layout and the production process were designed in accordance with the area, which resulted in a factory that was divided into 4 lanes, 9 rows per lane, including the design of new machines to help achieve semi-automatic production with lower investment than the commercialized technology from abroad."
"As a result, there are 2 production methods, namely Multi-lane Circulatory Pallet (MLCP), and Single-line Circulatory Pallet (SLCP), then the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed."
"Finally, it is an estimation of the investment and cost-effectiveness analysis of the establishment of this new factory."
"In five years, the factory is expected to yield a net present value (NPV) of 3.9 million baht, with an attractive internal rate of return (IRR) at 8.4%, and a payback period (PB) of 4 years and 2 months."
The results of the new factory design indicate that the precast concrete production business can be initiated at a lower investment cost and suitable for the potential of medium-sized construction companies.
