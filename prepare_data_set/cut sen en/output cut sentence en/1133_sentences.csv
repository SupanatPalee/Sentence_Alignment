This research aimed to reduce the time and process of separating corn kernels from cobs for agricultural use.
"The research investigated the data, set the objectives, designed and constructed the machine with the size of 620×720×1560 millimeters, driven by a motor and transmitted by a conveyer."
The shaft axis was attached to the chain and rotated at a constant speed.
"The machine was tested at the rotational speeds of 480, 720 and 1440 round/minute."
"The distance between chains were 70, 85 and 100 millimeters."
"The chain alignments were parallel, zigzag and double patterns."
"The results showed that, of the amount of 7 kilograms at 30 seconds, the separation efficiency was at 98 percent with the statistical significance of 0.05."
"The average from the experiment gave corn kernels of 5.95 kilograms, cobs of 0.99 kilograms and dust at 0.06 kilograms at the rotational speed of 720 round/minute."
The distance between chain was 85 millimeters.
The chain alignment was zigzag pattern.
