This research was focused on analyzing production and logistics cost of growing hydroponic and organic salad vegetables in Nakhon Sawan Province.
Activity-based costing was used to analyze the cost in each activity of growing salad vegetables.
This was conducted to reduce the production cost of the two methods of salad vegetable growing to be competitive with other markets.
Purposive sampling was used.
The data were collected by having an in-depth interview with ten entrepreneurs growing salad vegetables and their employees.
The results were found that the total production and logistics cost of growing hydroponic salad vegetables was higher than that of growing organic ones.
"In summer, the mean of the total cost of growing hydroponic and organic salad vegetables was 128 bahts per kilogram and 75-178 bahts per kilogram, respectively."
"The hydroponic entrepreneur 2 lost all of his vegetables due to the extremely hot air and water, so he cancelled his production during the summer."
"The cost of growing hydroponically and organically, 68-69 bahts per kilogram and 35-33 bahts per kilogram, respectively, was at the lowest level in the cold season."
The production cost ratio was higher than the logistics cost ratio.
"This was because of the high cost on labor hiring, 70% of the total production cost."
"The highest cost of the logistics activity was the transportation cost, 60% of the total logistics cost."
"Therefore, the approach to reduce production and logistics cost can be done by increasing products per growing areas and appropriate production and logistics management for business ecosystem as well as farming season."
