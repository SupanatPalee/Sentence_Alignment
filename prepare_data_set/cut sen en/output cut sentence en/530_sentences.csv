Oil splashing machine was design and built to help reduce time in procedure oil splashing of worker in small to medium enterprise.
"The prototype included machine frame size 900 × 900 × 1200 mm, bucket internal diameter 800 mm."
"and depth 500 mm, grille internal diameter 200 mm and depth 25 mm, and controlling system with 2 HP as the initial power of the oil splashing."
The experiment found that the machine peak performance spinning at 700 rpm and time in oil splashing 10 minute have minimum humidity 2.08 % and have volume oil 10.18 % with production at the maximum of 93 kg/day
