This research aimed to study the effect of paddy moisture on milling rice recovery.
"Thai Hom Mali rice 105, varieties were tested with a small rice milling machine."
"Not more than 10 kg, the average initial moisture content was 11.8 % and the average time of milling was 4.74 minutes, the average paddy flow rate was 2.85 kg/min."
"It was found that the milling Rice recovery was 3.89 kg, average broken rice 0.69 kg, average withered rice 1.32 kg, rice bran 1.19 kg, rice husk average 2.09 kg, impurity 1.21 kg, and whiteness of average rice 0.63%."
