This work studies the production and utilization of PV window louvers with a building.
Each louver contained 2 3 and 4 solar cells where a different cell number results in a different transparent and opaque area.
The angle of the louver with respect to the horizontal was adjusted to be 0º (fully open) 18º (partially open) and 90º (fully closed).
"The comparison is made for each louver performance in terms of electrical properties, the ability to ventilate air as well as the luminance inside the building."
It was found that the PV window louver conversion efficiency was in between 5-7%.
The maximum electrical energy production of 0.3-0.356 kWh occurred when each louver contains 4 solar cells.
The optimum louver angle for electrical energy production was found to be at 90º.
It was seen that at the angle of 0º the heat can be ventilated at a maximum rate.
"It was demonstrated that the heat passing through (Qcover) and heat inside the building (Qi,room) was lowest when the louver was installed at 90°."
"The internal luminance was measured to be higher than 500 Lux, which is the standard luminance requirement for office building, for all louver angles."
"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease Corona 2019 (COVID-19) has been in Wuhan, China since November 2019 and has spread to more than 160 countries around the world."
"As a result, the need to call for ambulances has increased from the incident."
Found that there are many patients who do not have an ambulance to pick them up after finding themselves with symptoms similar to the new coronavirus disease Corona 2019 (COVID-19).
It should find ways to improve the ambulance system to be able to respond to future epidemic incidents.
"Therefore, this study proposes the scheduling of epidemic patient transfers to quarantine hospitals for handling potential future epidemics using multiple 0–1 knapsack problem in scheduling simulations."
An ambulance to transport the patient to the hospital for quarantine.
"By scheduling an ambulance, the goal is to maximize the effectiveness of prioritizing patients in relation to their health status."
