The objectives of this research are to evaluate the phytochemical screening and acute toxicity against skin irritation and corrosion in rabbits from aqueous extract of Bouea burmanica Griff.
leaves.
"Phytochemical screening indicated the present of 4 groups of compound including phenolics, tannins, triterpenes and anthraquinones."
"Acute skin irritation and corrosion toxicity test in rabbits of the aqueous extract from the leaves of B. burmanica at the amount of 0.5Â±0.05 ml showed no swelling or redness of the skin in both rabbits at 24, 48 and 72 hours after application of the test material and over the entire period 14 days of the test."
The redness and swelling index of rabbit skin at the first 72 hours after application of the test material was 0 indicated that the aqueous extract from the leaves of B. burmanica was not irritating to rabbit skin.
"In addition, no behavioral abnormalities and clinical signs were observed during 14 days after application of the test material."
No rabbits were found dead or in pain during the testing period.
The results of this study showed that the aqueous extract from the leaves of the B. burmanica did not cause acute toxicity against skin irritation and corrosion in rabbits.
