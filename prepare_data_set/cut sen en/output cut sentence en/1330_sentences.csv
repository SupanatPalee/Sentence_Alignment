The objective of this research was to determine the thermal efficiency of the combined solar and biomass drying system for drying the 8 mm thickness of cassava chips.
"The passive drying system which has volume of 2x3x0.4 m3 and capacity of 50 kg of fresh cassava chips, it was operated with an inverted downdraft biomass gas stove."
The results showed that the average temperature of the combined solar and biomass drying system was 5-8oC higher than the solar dryer at all times.
"As a result, the moisture content of the cassava chips decreased from 60.5% (w.b.)"
to 14% (w.b.)
"with the least drying time of 11 h, while the solar dryer took 13 h and the solar traditional dryer took the longest 14 h. It was clearly seen that the heat from the biomass gas stove of this research increased the temperatures of the dryer and reduced drying time."
The overall thermal efficiency of this research was lowest 5.92% due to more heat loss from the heating equipment of the drying system.
