"The research aimed to 1) develop Augmented Reality Technology (AR) instructional media in “Chemical Reaction” with an efficiency of 80/80, 2) develop learning achievement in pre-test and post-test by using Augmented Reality Technology (AR) in “Chemical Reaction” with the 5E’s of Inquiry-Based Learning , and 3) study students’ satisfaction towards Augmented Reality Technology (AR) instructional media in “Chemical Reaction”."
The popular of this study was 74 Mattayomsuksa 3 students studying in semester 2 in academic year B.E.
2565.
The sample of this research was 37 Mattayomsuksa 3/5 students studying in semester 2 in academic year B.E.
2565 that was selected through cluster sampling.
"Research tools were 1) lesson plans Inquiry-Based Learning (5E) with Augmented Reality Technology (AR) instructional media of Inquiry-Based Learning (5E), 2) learning achievement test in “Chemical Reaction”, 3) Augmented Reality Technology (AR) instructional media in “Chemical Reaction”, and 4) The question of student satisfaction towards Augmented Reality Technology (AR) instructional media in “Chemical Reaction”."
"The findings showed that 1) The efficiency’s result of Augmented Reality Technology (AR) instructional media instructional media in “Chemical Reaction” had the efficiency (E1/E2) at 81.95/82.52 that were higher than an efficiency of 80/80, 2) students’ leaning achievement score of pre-test were higher than post-test was at the .05 level of significance with 11.14 of pre-test average point from 30 points at 37.13 percent and 24.76 of post-test average point from 30 points at 82.53, and 3) students’ satisfaction towards Augmented Reality Technology (AR) in “Chemical Reaction” were at the level of Very satisfied with 4.80 of an average score and 0.39 of standard deviation."
