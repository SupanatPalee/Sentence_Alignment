"The objective of this research is to apply lean manufacturing concept to improve production efficiency for the flat rubber sheet manufacturing enterprises in Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan and Bueng Kan provinces."
The production was labor intensive which required large quantities of physical effort to complete operation tasks.
The rubber sheet rolling machine is designed to combine 3 operations and used to improve rubber sheet production process.
"After the implementation the production process was reduced from 19 operations to 14 operations, representing an increase in work efficiency by 26.35%."
"The distance was reduced from 16.90 meters to 10.25 meters, representing a 39.35% increase in work efficiency and production time was reduced from 263 minutes to 187 minutes, representing a 15.53% increase in work efficiency."
"In conclusion, the production process was reduced by 5 operations, the distance was reduced by 6.65 meters, and the production time was reduced by 76 minutes."
