This paper presents the instability mitigation of AC-DC power system feeding a controlled buck converter by using a feedforward loop.
Power converters with their controls normally behave as constant power loads (CPLs).
These CPLs have negative resistance which may cause system instability.
"Therefore, it is essential to study the instability mitigation technique for improving the system stability."
The dynamic model derived from the DQ method and the generalized state-space averaging method (GSSA) is used with the eigenvalue theorem for the stability analysis.
The proposed instability mitigation is verified by the intensive time-domain in MATLAB.
The results show that the proposed instability mitigation in article is consistent with the stability analysis in theorem.
"In addition, the unstable system due to a constant power load can become back to the stable operation using the proposed technique."
