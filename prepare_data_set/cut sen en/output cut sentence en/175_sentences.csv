The objective of this research is to study the mechanical properties of dried bamboo for use in the structure of ancient umbrellas with constant bending load behavior.
"The bamboo specimens (Pai Ruak, Thyrsostachys siamensis) from the bottom, middle, and top of the bamboo culm were dried in a bamboo biomass oven at 60 °C and 70 °C to remove moisture from the wood until it is approximately 12.8%wb."
The dried bamboo was then subjected to mechanical properties testing with a universal testing machine (UTM) in an air-conditioned room at 25 °C and relative air humidity of approximately 65% to compare with bamboo that has been dried according to the standard test at 103 °C (reference).
"The average modulus of elasticity and flexural modulus of bamboo dried at 60 °C and 70 °C was less than that of bamboo dried according to the standard test (103 °C) by 38.21% and 18.07% for modulus of elasticity and 35.46% and 24.25% for flexural modulus, respectively."
