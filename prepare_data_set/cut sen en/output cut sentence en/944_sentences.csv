The aims of this research were to: 1) develop a decision support system for students and teachers to improve the quality of teaching and learning; 2) find the effectiveness of such a decision support system; 3) provide academic information to the administrators as a guideline for the development of the teaching process; 4) adjust the learning process of students so as to be effective.
"The target group consisted of students, teachers and administrators of the educational management."
Multi-dimensional database analysis was carried out.
"The data were analyzed by means of percentage, mean, standard deviation, and variance."
"The research findings are classified into 3 levels as follows: 1) the quality and satisfaction of the decision support system on the teaching quality of teachers from the administrators at the overall level was high (x = 4.44, SD = 0.64)."
"The reliability of information, as well as the speeding up of the processing and reporting of information to faculty members in each semester was effective; 2) the teaching quality of the instructors at Lampang Rajabhat University was high (x = 4.14, SD = 0.80); 3) the results of the evaluation showed that the students most needed the teacher to develop further their teaching style and to model the teaching process."
"In terms of knowledge transfer, the teaching and learning process was appropriate and easy to understand."
"The technical and instructional aspects of students' participation in determining the appropriate learning assessment standards in each group of students may have different factors, environments or skills."
