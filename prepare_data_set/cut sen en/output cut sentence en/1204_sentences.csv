Thispaperpresents a studyof liquefiedpetroleum gas (LPG)pool firebehaviors anddistanceestimation of 8 kW/m2 radiant heat flux level radiating from various sizes of the pool fires usingFire Dynamics Simulator (FDS).
Ten square pool fires with widths in a range of 2 – 20 meterswere modeled in a computational domain size of 65 x 100 x 60 cubic meters using a grid sizeof approximate 0.6 meter.
Weather and wind speed data in the Eastern part of Thailand wereinput to the models.
"Radiant heat fluxes at pool fire base level were measured by solid boundarymethod and radiant heat fluxes in the air at levels of 1 meter, 8 meters and 13 meters abovethe pool fire base were measured by gas-phase devices."
Heat release rates of the LPG pool firesas calculated by FDS were approximately the same as theoretical results with the relative errorin the range of 2.8 – 2.9 percent.
The trend of pool fire flame lengths was in accordance withThomas’s correlation [1]; the average relative error was at 8.7 percent.
Flame tilt angles wereless than the angles determined using AGA’s correlation [2] with the average relative error ashigh as 32.7 percent.
"At the pool fire base level, the radiant heat flux of 8 kW/m2 can radiateto distance in the range of 10.2 – 44.6 meters away from the pool fire center."
"At 1 meter and8 meters above pool fire base, the radiant heat flux of 8 kW/m2 can radiate to distance in therange of 7.5 – 52.5 meters from the center of a pool fire with width of 2 - 14 meters and todistance beyond 52.5 meters from the center of a pool fire with width of 16 meters or greater.At 13 meters above pool fire base, the radiant heat flux of 8 kW/m2 can radiate to distance inthe range of 7.5 – 47.5 meters from the center of a pool fire with width of 2 – 12 meters and todistance beyond 52.5 meters from the center of a pool fire with width of 14 meters or greater"
