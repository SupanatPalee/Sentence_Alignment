This research aimed to improve the quality inspection processes of QC staffs in e-commerce warehouse for sport and musical equipment which focused on goods returned rate from customers.
The returned products’ data from August to December 2019 were collected and analyzed then the results revealed that there were 4.52% of returned goods which caused by the error in quality inspection process before sending the goods from warehouse by QC staff.
"Then, Pareto diagram was used to analyze the main category of returned products and found that more than 80% of returned goods were damaged goods (63.86%) and stained goods (29.88%)."
"After that, the Why-Why analysis technique was used to find out the cause of defective goods and the results revealed that main causes were the lack of documented standard operating procedure for quality inspection process and lack of QC staff’s training in topic of working instruction and quality criteria decision."
"Therefore, the countermeasures were implemented including (1) preparation and issuing of standard operating procedure for QC staff, (2) training the correct procedure and methods for all QC staff, and (3) periodic evaluation of QC staff’s inspection ability."
The improvement results showed that the average amount of returned goods was reduced 37.95% and rate of returned goods compare with shipped goods was reduced 21.42%.
"These contributed to reduction of operations cost from 296,097.21 Baht/month to 100,533.13 Baht/month or 66.05% reduction."
"Therefore, cost saving after the countermeasures were implemented was 195,564.08 Baht/month or 2,346,768.96 Baht/year."
