"The objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of transverse baffles (TB) on Nusselt number (Nu), friction factor (f), and thermal enhancement factor (TEF) in the Reynolds number (Re) range of 6,000-24,000."
"In the experiments, the transverse baffles (TB) have the blockage height ratio (e/H) equal to 0.30, while keeping the baffle pitch to baffle height ratio (P/e) constant at 2."
"The results showed that for TB (e/H=0.30, P/e=2), the highest Nusselt number (Nu) value is 96.15 and the Reynolds number of 24,000."
"The transverse baffle (TB) gives the highest thermal enhancement factor (TEF) of 0.97 at a Reynolds number of 6,000."
