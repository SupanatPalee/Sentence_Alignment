The purpose of this research was to investigate the factors influencing and affecting the surface roughness of aluminum grade 2024 turning with carbide cutting tool using brand Plansee Tizit type DCGT 070204FN-27 H10T.
"The main factors were Speed, Feed, and Depth of Cut."
The experiment using aluminum with a diameter of 25 mm.
"was used at 1,300, 1,500, 1,700 rpm in Speed, Feed at 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 mm/rev, and Depth of Cut at 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 mm, respectively."
"It was found from the experiment that the factors affecting the surface roughness were Speed, Feed, and Depth of Cut with a tendency for reduction of roughness value at lower Feed and Depth of Cut and at greater Speed."
The turning condition was to be determined by mean of the equation Ra = 0.651 â€“ 0.000295 Speed + 0.485 Depth + 2.77 Feed.
The experiment was to confirm the result of a comparison between the equation and the percent accuracy with the margin of error.
"The result from the experiment of mean absolute percentage error (MEPE) of the equation of surface roughness was 3.15%, which was less than the margin of error and was acceptable."
