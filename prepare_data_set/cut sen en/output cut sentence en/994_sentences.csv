"The research aimed to present a method for determining the coffee ripeness from photographs in 4 types of ripeness: red (ripe), yellow (half ripe), green (raw) and brown (very ripe) by analyzing color characteristics with image processing."
The research process consisted of 4 stages.
"First, a color was converted from RGB to HSV color space."
"Second, colors were detected within a given HSV color range."
"Third, object contours were detected."
"Fourth, the object was framed."
"The results of testing the system performance on the accuracy of coffee classification from photographs showed that the efficiency of red (ripe) was 97%, yellow (half ripe) 95.67%, green (raw) and  brown (very ripe) 100%."
"Therefore, the average system efficiency was 98.17%, which was very high."
It can be concluded that the methods for determining the coffee ripeness from photographs will be very useful for developing a coffee color sorter.
