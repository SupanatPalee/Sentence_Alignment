The objective of this research is to increase the efficiency of inspection process for automotive parts: a case study of chassis.
The Spaghetti Chart was adopted to present routing of workers.
Fish bone diagram showed causes and effect of unnecessary distances in inspection process.
"Based on analyzing of current inspection process, it showed that total walking distance of inspection process was 87 meters and there was 21.80 minutes for this process."
Some equipment was misplaced.
"To place the equipment properly, we designed suitable containers by using Sketch up and located them near working area to reduce walking distance of workers."
"Also, Chassisâ€™ holder was changed to suit its function."
"The results showed that total walking distance of inspection process became 38.50 meters, or it was reduced by 55.75%."
The total time was also reduced to 21.30 minutes or by 2.29% and the percentage of employee reduction was 33.33.
