The research had an objective to present a concept of Energy Management Integration in Thailand i.e.
"energy management according to legislations integrating into energy management system according to International Standard: ISO 50001, by using research methodology with comparisons of contents and regulations towards the presentation of the importance of energy management system according to the International Standard ISO 50001:2018, which was found that both systems required very similar operation procedures, even though they were different in some details."
"Therefore, the organization could further develop an operation of the energy management according to legislations, which has already been operated by the organization."
"At present day, an energy management according to International Standard: ISO 50001 has been improved from the previous ISO 50001:2011 to be ISO 50001:2018."
"Moreover, industrial businesses are also necessary to keep other international standard systems (ISO) such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001."
These ISOs also were improved i.e.
9001:2008 to be ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2004 to be ISO 14001:2015.
"The International Standard Organization (ISO) attempts to improve the structures to be within the same level of the High-Level Structure or HLS on the base of Annex SL, which these standards can be integrated together."
"Therefore, this research took all 3 standards i.e."
"ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 50001:2018 for analyses in details to present the method to help the organization to integrate and management system: ISO 50001:2018 with the system of ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015, which the organization operates or has been certified to the integration with energy management according to legislation."
