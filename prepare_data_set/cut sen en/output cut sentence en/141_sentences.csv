"This research aims to propose the inventory policy that considers the break-even point under uncertain demands and price sensitivity of a company's product case study, which sells both wholesale and retail products                 in order to increase business liquidity and profit opportunity."
"In this study, it developed a mathematical model suitable for policies of the Min-Max order and the conditional discount."
Result from the study that the Min policy had a lower total inventory cost than other policies.
"While the Max policy and the conditional discount policy, the total inventory costs were different."
"According to the sensitivity analysis, it was found that the increasing or decreasing of products’ prices affected the selling price of products both retail and wholesale."
"Moreover, the conditions for trade discounts affect the level of money loss of each product differently."
"In the analysis of the break-even point, it was found that when the break-even point was 55% or more, Even though the purchase of goods had a trade discount or not."
It will result in a net profit selling more retail than wholesale.
