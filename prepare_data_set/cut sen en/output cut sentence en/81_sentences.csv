"The objectives of this research were to study the temperature distribution simulation in insulated Anila-type biochar kiln with size of 50, 100 and 200 liters and to study the effects of biomass material types, kiln size, and pyrolysis time on temperature distribution in the insulated biochar kiln, biochar yield, and biochar property."
The correlations between the variables related to the biochar production were furthermore investigated.
"The core of the kiln had a puncture diameter of 3.17 mm, number of the puncture of 15, 24 and 44, respectively."
The results showed that a 200-liter biochar kiln with biomass as the husk rice had the highest biochar yield of 51.1%.
"Based on the simulation results, the average temperature distribution at pyrolysis time of 1, 2 and 3 hours was 459.4±184.9 °C, 468.7±100.3 °C and 353.1±97.8 °C, respectively, when compared with the experiment results the error was 6.5±6.2, 3.9±4.1 and 0.9±0.9%, respectively."
"From the correlation equation, it was found that average temperature inside the kiln had no significant effect on the biochar yield and acidity-alkalinity."
"On the other hand, the kiln dimensional parameters, i.e."
"A/Ap, L/D, pyrolysis time and biomass material type had an effect on the biochar yield."
"Furthermore, the A/Ap, L/D and pyrolysis time had an effect on the acidity-alkalinity of biochar as well."
"From the results of this research, the temperature distribution characteristics of different kiln sizes and conditions affecting the biochar yield and acidity-alkalinity obtained from the biochar production were revealed."
