This paper presents an adaptive interference cancellation based on normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm for electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement.
"In general, properties of ECG signal and interference cancellation are described while ECG measuring."
Basic concept of adaptive filtering based on LMS algorithm is explained shortly how to design for adaptive linear filtering for ECG interference cancellation.
A set of dataset of ECG signal is used for simulation.
Experimental results show that the proposed adaptive filtering based on NLMS algorithm can suppress the interference from ECG measurement in term of mean square deviation.
