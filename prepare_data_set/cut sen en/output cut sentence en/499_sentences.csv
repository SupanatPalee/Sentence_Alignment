This paper presents the impact of grid-connected solar rooftop for high penetration in low voltage distribution network of the 24000-416/240 V grid system.
"Transformer capacity is 2500 kVA which each loaded 85%, 3% and 12% respectively."
The study considers the different load profiles at factory and office.
the hourly load profile of an organic fertilizer plant in Thailand base on work schedule is presented.
"Using the load profile, a solar rooftop system has been designed."
PVWatts Calculator program has been used for forcasting capacity of the system.
"In this study, the DIgSILENT PowerFactory program is used to simulate and analyze Power flow, Voltage stability and Power factor at the proposed distribution network."
"Therefore, this research presents the effect of installing a rooftop solar power system with and without a battery in an organic fertilizer plant."
"For the results obtained from this research, it will create recommendations that can be considered for practical use in."
