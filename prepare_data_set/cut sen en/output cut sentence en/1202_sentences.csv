The purpose of this research is to study the behavior of subbase pavement that carries onthe heavy traffic load.
The Nan’s lateritic-soil samples were used for improvement physical soilproperties.
"The natural physical properties of this soil are as following, the plasticity index valueis 16.08, specific gravity is 2.62, maximum dry density using modifies proctor compaction testis 1.98 g/cm3, optimum moisture content is 16.50% and this soil is classified as ML (Silt LowPlasticity) type."
The results of this research show that mixing Nan’s lateritic-soil with Fuji Beton inthe proportion of 3-7% by weight present unconfined compressive strength values 7.31-19.29ksc.
"Mixing Nan’s lateritic-soil, with Fuji Beton3-7% and para-rubber 3-5% by weight presentunconfined compressive strength values 4.96-18.11 ksc."
"This research found that the appropriateproportionof mixingratio among Nan’s lateritic-soil,Fuji Betonandpara-rubber couldbe followedthe department of highways standard were 1) Nan’s lateritic soil with 6 wt% Fuji Beton and 2)Nan’s lateritic soil with 7 wt% Fuji Beton and 5 wt% para rubber latex presenting unconfinedcompressive strength values more than 17.50 ksc as specification of standard of Department ofHighways (DOH)."
Thus this canbe concludedthat Nan’s lateritic-soil mixed withthoseproportionsabove could be used as subbase course material of pavement structure
