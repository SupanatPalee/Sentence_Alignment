The objective of this study was to develop the dynamic modeling of recirculation plug-flow areal reactor recirculation completely-mixed stirred tank areal reactor (RPFAR) of recirculation Subsurface flow constructed wetland (RSFCW) using granular activated carbon (GAC) as a media contained in 11 pots of reed.
"The ratio of width to : length was >1:4, used area was 0.04 m2, and the initial height of bed 25 cm."
The result of the study found that the recirculation ratio: QR/Qin (R) was 7.
The hydraulic recirculation time (HReT) was 0.5 hrs for treating waste water.
"As a result, the efficiency of BOD removal was 88.94%, respectively which cause the second-order-reaction with areal rate coefficient (kA2nd) equals 18.006 m/day, respectively."
