The cost of thin film fabrication using spark technique was low.
The principle is to use two electrodes of high voltages for sparking in order to let vapors of indium and tin of wire fall down to the surface on silicon wafer.
"In this research, the properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin film on silicon wafer from sparking voltage at 4 kV, 7 kV and 10 kV were studies."
The ITO thin film was annealing at 250C for 180 minutes and the surface of thin film was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM/EDS).
"It was found that, the surface of ITO thin film was the Amorphous film when high voltage was 7 kV and 10 kV."
"However, it was confirmed that the voltage at 4 kV cannot find characteristic of the film in any way."
"In addition, the higher voltage of the spark was resulted in the uniform of surface in the film."
