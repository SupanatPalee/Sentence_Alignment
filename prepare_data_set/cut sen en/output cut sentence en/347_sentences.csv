This paper presents an analysis of the electric field at the surface of pin type insulator model 56-2 which is used in a 22kV distribution system.
The simulation is performed based on a mathematical model in the form of a differential equation with three dimension finite element method.
"In addition, this paper focuses on the electric field comparison on surface insulator under three contaminate conditions such as dusts water drips and sea drips."
"Moreover, the simulation results to analyze the chance of flash over phenomenon on the surface insulator."
The simulation results show that the maximum electric field of 144.18 V/mm occurred while the insulator is under a sea drips contaminated condition and has the most possibility prone to flash over phenomenon.
"On the other hand, the insulator installed on a water drips contaminated condition has the least possibility prone to flash over."
