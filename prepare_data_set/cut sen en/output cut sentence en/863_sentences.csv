This research presents the development of the RISDA simulation-based learning model for industrial electronics education.
"The research methodology begins with a survey of needs from stakeholders based on the requirements of the graduate's competencies, then develops a simulation-based learning and teaching model called the RISDA model."
"The RISDA model comprises five stages; Recall, Information, Simulation, Discussion, and Assessment."
"The research tools were constructed, such as teacher manuals of industrial electronics, learning activity plans, simulation-based teaching media, and objective tests."
"Then, they were used to implement a sample of 20 undergraduate students program in industrial technology at Burapha University."
"The results showed that 1) the developed instructional package was effective with 76.42/76.08 according to the standard criteria 75/75, 2) learners who had learned using the RISDA model had their satisfaction at a high level (the mean was 4.48)."
The developed RISDA model can promote learners' competencies in line with 21st-century learning skills and appropriately accommodate workplace needs.
