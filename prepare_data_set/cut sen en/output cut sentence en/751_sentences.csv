The Stirred Tank Reactor (STR) is widely used in the industry.
Understanding the flow characteristics within the tank is important in determining the performance of the mixing process.
The objective of this paper presents the study of the flow characteristics and velocity distribution of fluid within the Stirred Tank Reactor (STR) using 8 blades Rushton turbines in the middle of the tank to drive.
Calculate the flow results using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
The Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using to capture the turbulence and the Sliding Mesh technique (SM) to simulate the impeller motion.
"The study of mixing characteristics at impeller speeds of 100, 200, and 300 rpm."
The study results showed that the tangent velocity generated vortex flow around the shaft within the stirring tank.
"When continuous mixing, the flow characteristics will be steady-state."
This flow characteristic affects the mixing capability of the process that requires turbulence for the mass transfer between the fluids.
However maintaining turbulence in the mixing process required high energy.

The case study factory is a furniture factory where the Line Gen production process is responsible for producing sample furniture as well as managing various repairs and work that is returned for repairs.
The production process focuses on the speed of production.
"Currently, there are problems with returns and rejected work in the production process of Line Gen."
"There were errors in determining delivery dates and preparing raw materials for production, including the lack of clear coordination among each relevant department, resulting in production work exceeding the delivery deadline."
There were thus delays in the production of furniture.
"Therefore, in order to solve these problems, this research has prepared a standard work manual (Work Instructions: WI) and a production sequence plan checklist, including capacity analysis."
"The results show that before the improvement, 80 returned jobs were generated, of which 38 exceeded the transfer date of 47.5%, and the number of days beyond the average transfer period was 2.42 days."
"After the improvement, 68 jobs were returned, 17 of which exceeded the transfer deadline (25%), and the days beyond the transfer deadline decreased on average to 1.47 days."
"In the case of rejecting jobs before improvement, there was a total of 96 jobs, 77 of which were beyond the transfer date of 80.2%, and the number of days beyond the average transfer period was 4.56 days."
"After improvements, there were 98 rejected jobs, with 49 jobs exceeding 50% of the transfer date, and we were able to reduce the average transfer overdue days to 2.24 days."
