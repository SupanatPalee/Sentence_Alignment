"In this research, the behavior of hardness and abrasive wear resistance of semi-multi-alloyed white cast iron with different Cr contents was investigated."
"The cast irons with 5%, 7% and 9 wt% (hereafter wt% is expressed by %) were prepared."
The specimens were annealed at 950 oC.
The annealed specimens were hardened from 1050 and 1100 oC austenitizing by fan air cooling.
"As-hardened specimens were tempered at three level temperatures between 450 and 620 oC: the temperature giving the maximum tempered hardness (HTmax), the lower and higher temperatures than HTmax (L-HTmax and H-HTmax)."
The abrasive wear resistance was evaluated using Suga abrasion tester.
The results showed that the microstructure and hardness of specimens varied depending on Cr content and heat treatment condition.
The highest hardness was obtained in the specimen with 7%Cr hardened from 1100 oC.
A linear relationship between wear loss and wear distance was obtained in all specimens.
"The lowest wear rate (Rw, mg/m) was obtained in the as-hardened or HTmax specimen and the highest value was obtained in the L-HTmax or H-HTmax specimen."
The Rw decreased progressively as the hardness increased.
"The Rw decreased slowly as the Cr content rose to 7%Cr and then, increased gradually as the Cr content rose."
The highest wear resistance was obtained in the specimen with 7%Cr hardened from 1100 oC.
