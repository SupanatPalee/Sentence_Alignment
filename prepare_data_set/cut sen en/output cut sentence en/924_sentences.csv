The aim of this research was to design and construct a hospital patient food trolley driven by DC motor.
"The study was carried out at Sermngam Hospital, Lampang."
"The design dimensions of the trolley had a width of 0.8 meters, a length and height of 1.2 meters, and could accommodate 32 trays of food with a total weight of not more than 200 kilograms."
The structure and body of the trolley were made of stainless steel.
"Power was transmitted using a DC Motor via conveyor belts with a power rating of 500 watts, 24 volts."
"Having performed standard test drives on a horizontal level and a slope of 15 degrees, results showed that the trolley could drive on slopes not more than 15 degrees at a maximum speed of 2.88 kilometers per hour."
The duration of battery usage in the case of continuous use was 2 hours.
"In the case of food transportation along the Sermngam Lampang hospital route, the trolley covered a distance of 660 meters per day."
The battery can be used for 5 days per single charge and has an average lifetime of 8-10 months.
