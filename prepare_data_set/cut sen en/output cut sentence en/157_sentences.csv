"In this research, the focus will be on the improvement and development of biodegradable materials."
The study has observed the insert injection molding process in which the matrix in the molten polymer and inserted non-woven fabric into the cavity.
Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) has been used to be the polymer matrix and non-woven fabric as a reinforcement in the process.
"Accordingly, the specimens are the composite PLA that was reinforced with and without nonwoven fabric."
"Moreover, study the morphological properties, mechanical properties."
"As a result, it was found that the reinforced PLAs with non-woven fabric."
"Non-woven fabric preparation conditions at the melt pump 14 rpm drawing jet pressure 20 psi, tensile strength properties peel strength and the 3-point flexural strength were the best, which were 53.53, 11.53, 50.89 MPa, respectively."
when compared to polymer composite without non-woven fabric.
