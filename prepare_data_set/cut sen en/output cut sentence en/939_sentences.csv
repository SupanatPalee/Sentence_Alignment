This research involved a technical feasibility study for the drying of bananas using waste heat from a split type air conditioning system.
"The experimental equipment consisted of a split type air conditioning system with a capacity of 10.55 kW (36,000 BTU/hr), R-22 refrigerant as the working fluid, and a water cooled heat exchanger using a water flow rate of 10 LPM."
"In this study, a drying oven was made from 1 mm."
"thick stainless steel board with a width of 0.8 m., a length of 0.6 m., and height of 0.7 m. The drying oven had 5 trays inside with 10 cm spacing between each tray, and an air flow rate passing through the drying oven of 1.10 kg/s."
"When the bananas were dried using waste heat from the air conditioning system, the initial weight of the bananas was 10 kg and the final weight was 4.35 kg within 62 hours."
"The result showed that the bananas were dried down to 50% MCdb (moisture content dry basis) when the heat exchanged the water flowing out from the condenser to the heat exchanger device, with an average water temperature of  48.35oC and an average temperature inside the oven of 46.23oC."
