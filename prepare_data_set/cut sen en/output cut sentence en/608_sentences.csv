This paper presents the effects of partial fine aggregate replacement by recycled gypsum board in mortar for producing fiber-cement sheets conformed to TIS 1427-2540 Fiber-cement sheets: Flat sheets.
"The results showed that fine aggregate volume could be replaced by recycled gypsum board up to 0.20 by mortar volume which affected the tested modulus of rupture of 4.03, 4.41 and 4.42 MPa with water to cement ratio (W/C) of 0.40, 0.45 and 0.50, respectively."
Those mortars passed the standard of fiber-cement sheets type 1 with the modulus of rupture higher than 4 MPa.
"However, mortar with recycled gypsum board could not protect water penetration."
"Therefore, those mortars were put in fiber-cement sheets type A and B that could be used indoor or outdoor without directly facing sunlight and water."
