This paper presents the bond behavior between concrete and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates.
"The studied behavior includes the bond strength, effective bond length, bond stress-slip relationship, and failure mode."
A single shear pushing test method was conducted.
"The concrete prisms (150×150×500 mm) were adhesively bonded with CFRP plates of different bond lengths (100,200,300, and 400 mm)."
The results showed that the debonding failure occurred at concrete substrate.
The effective bond length could reasonably be predicted by Fib14 equation.
"Also, the ACI 440.2R equation for debonding strain of FRP plates predict higher values than the test data."
"Based on the test data, different models for constructing the bond stress-slip relationships were assessed."
The interfacial fracture energy values obtained from Popovic and bi-linear models were found to be similar and higher than ones obtained from Dai et al.
(2005) method.
