This research is a study of the approach to improve service quality of minibuses by managing the number of buses in accordance with the appropriate service intervals and efficiency.
"Because at present, the service providers still lack a system that meet the needs of service users that may result in the problem of congestion and overcrowding on minibuses and unsafe trips."
The researcher studied and collected data in 2 important areas at the bus stop in front of Payup Temple and New Klang Plaza Department Store.
"Then, the data was analyzed for service intervals and service users of minibuses and used simulation techniques to find the average number of people waiting in the parking area during rush hour to compare the efficiency of System 1 to System 4 at the same time, find a 95 percent confidence interval."
"The results showed that the most suitable service unit during the morning rush hour by considering to increase the number of minibus trips of Line 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 15 and 4287 by one server unit each as for the Line 7 has the most service users, so consider adding by two server units."
