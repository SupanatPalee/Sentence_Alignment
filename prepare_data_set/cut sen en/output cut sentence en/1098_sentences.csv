This research aims to study on sweet basil essential oil extraction by using microwave-steam distillation system.
"The distillation system consisted of three main parts: 1) essential oil distillation unit, 2) steam generator unit and 3) essential oil separator condensing unit."
"To demonstrate the potential of a new technique, microwave-steam distillation method (MSD) has been compared with conventional steam distillation method (SD)."
"Results show that the essential oil extracted by MSD process was quantitatively (oil yield) similar to those obtained by SD process, but MSD was better than SD in terms of process rapidity (34.36% lower distillate time), thereby allowing substantial saving of electric consumption (32.37% lower electric consumption)."
