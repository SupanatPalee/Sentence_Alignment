"This research is developed of the 7-level automatic fish feed-sewing machine with set timer to reduce human labor, save time and reduce costs for aquaculture in ponds."
The experimental to determine the rate of feed with the speed of rotation (left-right) is 2 levels of 33.33 and 46.15 rpm and the level of sowing is 7 levels of 1 to 7 (7 wind speed).
The results showed that the level of sowing level of 1-3 causes the rate of animal feed increased to the maximum is 30 kg/min.
"However, when the level of sowing is 4-7 of the both rotation speed that the rate of animal feed is decrease similar."
"When, it is using the 7-level automatic fish feed-sewing machine will result to can reduce labor and reduce the cost of raising animals."
