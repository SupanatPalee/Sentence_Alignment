This paper presents the development of innovation-based learning using single computer board and mini-project on course of CPE2227 advanced digital system.
Innovation-based learning is used to motivate the junior computer engineering students to understand clearly for in-depth of advanced digital system course.
"This course concerns with the digital system, that is the basic structure of innovation in this recent."
"In laboratory course of CPE2227 course is used to practice the computer students in the teamwork, problem-based solving, creative thinking skills at computer engineering in Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University."
This practical course in laboratory covers the theoretical foundation of advanced digital course about hardware and software design as computer programming and application development.
"According to Covid-19 pandemic in Thailand, this course is developed for the hybrid course consisting of online and on-site with the environment changes."
Learning outcomes of this course supports and encourages the students to understand the basic knowledge for innovation and senior project through the course activities.
