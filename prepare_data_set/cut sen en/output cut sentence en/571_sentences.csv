This research aims to reduce the defective rate from cracking paint and thin paint defects in Powder Coated Painting process of window frame of canopy.
This research applied the Six Sigma approach for improvement.
"Firstly, the problem was defined."
"Secondly, the accuracy and the precision of the inspection system were appraised."
"After that, the potential causes for cracking and thin paint defects were analyzed by brain storming and using the cause and effect diagram and the cause and effect matrix to identify key process input variables."
"Then, the five factors were experimented to find the regression equation showing the relationship between the defective rate and the significant factors."
"Next, the optimal values of significant factors were found and implemented."
"The improvement led to the reduction of defective rate from 8 percent to 1.13 percent and the reduction of the rework cost of 6,877,484 baht per year."
