This research aims to study the efficiency of vehicle speed reduction measures according to the law on National Highway No.
"12, from Ban Krang Intersection - Indochina Intersection, Phitsanulok Province at a speed limit of 80 km/h through the city, a distance of 14.5 km."
"There are 4 data collection locations, namely, point 1 at km."
225 – km.
"228, point 2 km."
228 – km.
"233, point 3 km."
233 – km.
"237, and point 4 km."
237 – km.
"240 which related to the determination of 3 types of speed reduction measures, namely 1) warning signs, 2) speed cameras, and 3) rumble strips with warning signs for off- peak 6 hours per day."
The results of the study found that the majority of motorists used the speed limit in both directions.
"In the direction A (Ban Krang Intersection - Indochina Intersection), drivers used the 85th percentile speed, equal to 85.3 km/h, 79.4 km/h, 86.2 km/h, and 85.1 km/h, respectively, for direction B (Indochina Intersection - Ban Krang Intersection) is equal to 89.5 km/h, 80.0 km/h, 86.5 km/h, and 85.2 km/h, respectively, with only in point 2 (speed camera) where drivers follow the speed limit."
The researcher therefore recommends those involved or responsible for road safety to develop a new road speed reduction measure to enhance travel safety and make drivers comply with the speed limit.
