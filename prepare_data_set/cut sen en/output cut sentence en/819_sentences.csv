Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is used for Aluminum Alloys 5154 welding process.
The weld porosity defect often occurred in the aluminum Alloys welding that could affect mechanical properties.
"Accordingly, the mechanical properties did not meet the regulation TISI."
2707-2558 (ISO 20703:2006).
"Thus, the current and travel speed were studied."
"The bend testing, tensile testing and weld bead quality were assessed along with macrostructure analysis, microstructure analysis and radiographic testing."
The study was found that the best condition for the finest weld bead was at the current 200 Amp with the travel speed 75 cm/min.
