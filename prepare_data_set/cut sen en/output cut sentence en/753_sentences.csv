Active Optical Cable or AOC is commonly used for high speed data transmission (100Gb/s) in many applications including Datacenter with continuous growth of demand.
"To make this product is competitive in the market, manufacturing process need to have high efficiency and low cost."
"This research aims to improve AOC assembly process particularly in optical engine level with Six sigma methodology DMAIC which consist of 5 phases as follow, (1) Define phase is to consider the most critical process and estimate and improvement target."
"(2) Measure phase, to analyze accuracy and precision of measurement system."
"(3) Analyze phase, to brainstorm possible cause and proceed statistical test to verify which input factor give significant different to defective rate."
(4) Improve phase is to determine an effective solution for each factor.
And the last (5) Control phase to follow up target achievement.
The average defective rate is decreased from 10.96% to 1.49% or equal to 85%.
This research can achieve breakthrough improvement by conducting Six sigma approach.
An objective of this research is to study and improve the production process to reduce the usage of production area by combining production lines.
A case study factory was a stereo manufacturer which needed the area for a new production line.
"A methodology started from studying and analyzing each production process, then choosing the production line to be removed and finally improving the production line to receive products from the removed production line."
"Main concepts for analysis and improvement consisted of work study, capability analysis and line balancing."
The selected production lines to be combined considered from capacity utilization rate and limitations of the equipment and machine.
"An improvement of the production line to receive products from the removed production line was to sequence tasks to stations by considering line balancing, cycle time and production conditions."
"After reducing the line and improving the process, the factory had an additional area as expected and could move the product to produce in another line without any problems."
"In addition, reducing the production line and moving products to be produced in another line also increased capacity utilization rate from 32 % to 55%."
