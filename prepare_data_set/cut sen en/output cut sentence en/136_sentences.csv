This research is a primary study of polypropylene composites mixed with rice husk ash.
"Polypropylene in this study was recycled from drinking water bottles, hot food packaging bags, bags of saline solution, and storage baskets."
"Two sizes of rich husk ash were used in this study, 17 and 29 µm, mixed with recycled polypropylene at 1:7 PHR proportion."
The compound preparation process was made possible a with Twin Screw Extruder and the composite and sample works were created by a hot-pressing process.
Results of this study indicated that the types of recycled-polypropylene affected the mechanical and physical properties significantly.
"The size of rice husk ash affected the hardness value, impact resistance value, and melting index."
"Increasing the proportion of rice husk ash from 1 to 7 PHR significantly affected the tensile strength, hardness value, impact resistance value, and melting index."
The possible trend of this study revealed that a higher proportion of rice husk ash addition resulted in higher hardness and Young’s modulus values.
"However, it reduced the impact resistance, the stretch percentage, and melting index values."
"In terms of the different sizes of rice husk ash addition, it was found that the impact resistance value of composites, which had rice husk ash of 29 µm addition was higher than rich husk ash of 17 µm."
"In terms of the melting index, the value of composites which had rice husk ash of 17 µm addition was higher than composites which had rice husk ash of 29 µm addition."
"Consequently, the composite from this study could be used to form sample products."
