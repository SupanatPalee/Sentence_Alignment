The purposes of this study were to 1) Create a teaching package on servo motor control with PLC.
2) Compare the learning achievement of learners learning with the created teaching package.
and 3) Study the satisfaction of learners learning from teaching package.
Teaching how to control a servo motor with PLC.
The samples used in this research were under graduate students of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.)
Minburi Technical College.
"Mechatronics and Robotics Technology majors who enrolled in electric drive and servo systems (code 33-4127-3001), 11 students."
Teaching Achievement Test and Student Satisfaction Assessment.
"The statistics used to analyze the data were mean, standard deviation, and Dependent T-test."
"Major Findings: 1) teaching package on servo motor control with PLC had an efficiency of 1.251 according to the Mcguiganâ€™s formula, which 2) Learners' learning achievement after passing the teaching package on servo motor control."
The developed PLC was significantly higher than before learning at the 0.01 level and 3) the student's satisfaction towards the teaching package on servo motor control with the constructed PLC was at a high level.
The research results obtained can be used as a guideline for creating a teaching package and If the teacher who will use this teaching package must understand the content.
how to use teaching aids well in order to make teaching and learning the most effective
