This article presents the application a Saving Algorithm.
This purpose is the minimized total distances.
The case study considers limitation of the catfish-carrying vehicle capacity on 2 trucks and 4 customers.
The result of the case study is compared with the mathematical method by Lingo modeling program and Saving Algorithm.
"From the study result found that, the proposed method (Saving Algorithm: SA) and the mathematical model could reduce the total distance from 203 kilometers to 183 kilometers or 9.9% and the fuel cost could decrease from the 672.32 baht to 606.10 baht."
