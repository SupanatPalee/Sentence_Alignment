by integrating more scientific processes into another dimension to connect relationships From the evidence of traces of art that exist.
The restoration approach uses scientific studies to correlate the correlation with the evidence of cracked glass traces built in the past.
"With X-ray techniques, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (EDXRF) can perform qualitative analysis in a short time and can detect many elements at once without damaging or causing material loss."
original condition Used to determine the elemental composition of surfaces from the submission of antique torn glass samples.
"from the base of Phra Sri Sakyamuni in the Grand Palace Wat Suthat Thepwararam Ratchaworawihan In the examination of the elements, it was found that The glass texture of the cracked glass is mainly composed of lead 60-70% by weight, consistent with the paint mixing formula."
Of the family line Tajaya (Tajaya).
with lead as the main component When tested for hardness according to the Mohr's scale of hardness equal to 2-5 and high brittleness.
