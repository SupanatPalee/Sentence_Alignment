"This study focuses on assessing the effectiveness of speed bumps in the Bang Sao Thong district, Samut Prakan province."
The primary objective is to examine the impact of speed bumps on vehicle speeds with the aim of reducing accidents and associated losses significantly.
"However, speed bumps are considered road obstacles, and this study emphasizes their importance while comparing vehicle speeds before and after encountering speed bumps of various designs."
The categorization is based on the width of the speed bump.
"The research findings indicate that speed bumps with a width not exceeding 0.90 meters result in an average speed reduction of 39.93%, while those with a width greater than 0.90 meters lead to an average speed reduction of 48.71%."
The study concludes that speed bumps wider than 0.90 meters significantly affect the effectiveness of speed reduction for vehicles passing over them independently on the specific road segment.
It recommends continuous maintenance and improvements to ensure optimal functionality.
"Statistical analysis shows a significant difference in vehicle speeds before and during interaction with speed bumps, particularly with widths below and above 0.90 meters, rejecting the null hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level."
"In summary, the study suggests that adjustments and enhancements to speed bump designs can contribute to more effective speed control, ultimately enhancing road safety."
