The application of electrical energy from solar cells to automatic control humidity in mushroom.
"Objective to test the system, the electric power from the solar cell to the test in mushroom house sizes width 2 × length 4 × high 3 meters."
"The installation of humidity control systems automatically using misting system increases humidity control features a two position (on-off), which receives the signal from the probe moisture IC sends control signals to control moisture automation can control."
Add moisture to the house through a fog nozzle relay using energy from the electrical energy by the solar cells.
Testing by the control relative humidity in the house is less than 80 percent of the water before they mushroom house and two greenhouse  .Test results are automatically sheds moisture control humidity average of 80.70 percent.
Electrical energy by the solar cells.
"Electric power produced by an average of 29.42 watts of power for the system average 20.34 watts of electricity by an average of 1.63 ampere of electricity use in the system average was 1.06 ampere, enough to use."
