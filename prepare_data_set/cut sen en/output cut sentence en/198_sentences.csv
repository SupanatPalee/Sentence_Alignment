This research investigates the probability of using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic waste to replace asphalt cement for asphalt concrete pavement.
"Factors influencing this research were aggregate, binder (asphalt cement), and HDPE plastic waste content."
"This research investigated stability, flow, indirect tensile strength, and resilient modulus of samples."
"Test results showed that the stability, indirect tensile strength, and resilient modulus of asphalt concrete improved with HDPE plastic waste were higher than those of asphalt concrete for all HDPE plastic waste content."
The HDPE plastic waste content affected the engineering properties of asphalt concrete improved with HDPE plastic waste.
The indirect tensile strength and resilient modulus of asphalt concrete improved with HDPE plastic waste increased as HDPE plastic waste content increased.
"This research is beneficial for using HDPE plastic waste as an additive to enhance the engineering properties of asphalt concrete pavement, reducing environmental pollution and the use of waste materials."
