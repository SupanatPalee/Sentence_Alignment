"In this paper presents the design of M-ary phase modulation, especially when M is odd number."
"By adding dummy input data into a DAC circuit, in order to make an input balance on both sides of DACs by using the relation of all inputs to reduce the complexity of circuit with K-Map before multiplying this signal by carrier signal."
"After that, combine those signals to obtain the phase modulated signal as desired."
"The simulation results shown that the status of phase signals is changed correctly.In addition, the proposed method can be used for cases where M is even value."
