This paper proposes the analysis of external lightning protection system in dieselengine plant.
Currently factory is using unconventional system (Early Streamer Emission;ESE).
"After using this lightning protection system, it was found that a lightning strikeat the factory resulted in damage to equipment and factory."
"The study presents that ESElightning protection has not been standardized for lightning protection in accordance withinternational standards (IEC 62305) and Thailand Standard (EIT Standard 2009-53);therefore, the research focuses on examination of the advantages and disadvantages ofESE lightning protection systems as defining in international standards."
"In addition designof external lightning protection system to the factory to meet the standards was doneby consider the risks and opportunity for lightning strikes against the factory, physicalcharacteristics of the factory and grounding, and compared costs of improving lightningprotection."
