Ergonomics problems affects operator’s health and performance.
This research applies Analytic Hierarchy Process to order the procedures that involved ergonomic.
The objective was to order a Provincial Electricity Authority’s hotline process that affected ergonomics by Analytic Hierarchy Process application.
Ergonomics problems of hotline operators were used as factors in the hotline process priorities analysis.
"The factors included working posture, duration, work load, frequency and external threats."
"The result shows that the frequency factor has the highest mean weight followed by working posture and workload, mean weight equal to 0.364, 0.258 and 0.194 respectively."
The process that has the most important ergonomics problems was disconnecting and connecting high voltage distribution on double dead end pole and buck arm pole that connected with PG clamp or connecting tube.
"The second was electric pole additional construction followed by installing/ demolition of remote-control switch, mean weight equal to 0.164, 0.162 and 0.145 respectively."
