The objective of this research was to study and determine the most effective installation layout position of flood warning devices which form part of the development of the Flash Flood Warning System located in at-risk areas.
"In this study, the area was Huai Nam Nak village, Ta Nao Si sub-district, Suang Phueng district, in Ratchaburi province."
This has been classed as a risky area as it has been affected by flash flooding in the past.
"By applying an action research methodology, data collection and analysis was conducted in real life contexts."
The results of research were as follows: the flash flood warning system consists of a device that measure the rain levels which are automatically linked to the master station and the remote station which are installed locally in each community.
These are known as a “Household Warning Box” in the Huai Nam Nak village community.
The Household Warning Box will show a disaster warning light level bar and sound an alarm in the event of an evacuation for the community who live downstream at a 95% level of effectiveness.
"As a result, community members can co-exist safely even in those areas where natural disasters occur."
