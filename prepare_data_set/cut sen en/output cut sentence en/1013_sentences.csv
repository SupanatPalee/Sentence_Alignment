Cultural tourism is a kind of tourism whose aim is to learn the values of culture which indicates the uniqueness of each locality.
"Each region of Thailand has its own distinct local culture, but there is one popular activity done much in common called Nine Temple Merit Tour which is believed to bring prosperity to life and family."
"This research aims to study factors concerning tourism routes, and it was conducted by using a questionnaire to survey and conducting road safety audits (existing roads)."
"This is to propose guidelines for the development of cultural tourism maps, “Merit Route”."
The results of the study revealed that the distance factor was the most important factor for tourists.
"In addition, the road safety audit was found that there were some issues of traffic sign defects, traffic marking, general characteristics of intersections, and alignment of the road on tourist routes that may cause insecurity in life and property."
