"In this paper, we present the study and comparison of the ultrasonic sensors for object height measurement with three different shapes including the hen egg with ellipse shaped, matchbox with square shaped and table tennis ball with round shaped."
Determine the distance between the reference distance and the ultrasonic sensor device with 5 levels as 100 150 200 250 and 300 mm.
respectively.
It develops from previous researches which studied on the different shapes objects not yet.
Experiment results show that the matchbox is given the best measurement the hen egg is subordinated and at least the table tennis ball.
The accuracy rate of the measurement of height as the highest and least is following.
The reference distance at 100 and 300 mm.
"of the matchbox is 92.64% and 61.57%, at 100 and 300 mm."
of the hen egg is 75.57% and less than 0.1% and at 100 and 150 mm.
of the table tennis ball is 43.75% and less than 0.1%.
