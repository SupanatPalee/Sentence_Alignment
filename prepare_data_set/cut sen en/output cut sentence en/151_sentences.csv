"This research focused on the compressive strength, flexural strength, and water permeability of porous concrete."
"Round aluminum wire in two diameters of 2 mm and 4 mm, was combined with cement to coarse aggregate in a ratio of 1:25, limestone in which retained on sieve No."
"4, and superplasticizer."
The sample of porous concrete blocks sizing 52×20×7.5 (length × width x depth/ height) cm was used in this whole experiment.
The addition of 2 mm and 4 mm aluminum wires in two forms of wire reinforcement in porous concrete was studied.
"According to the results, sizing of aluminum wire revealed an impact on the increase in flexural strength of porous concrete than compressive strength."
The sizing of an aluminum wire affected to the obtained flexural strength than reinforcing form.
The water permeability of porous concrete (k) was 1.99 cm/s at the age of 28 days.
The water permeability of porous concrete was not significantly affected by the curing time.
