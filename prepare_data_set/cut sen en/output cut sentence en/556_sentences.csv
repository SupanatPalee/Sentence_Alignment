This research studies the effects of using phase change material in the cooling system of a 105 L single door refrigerator.
"Installed the phase change material together with the cooling pipe instead of the original evaporator position, with melting temperature of -15 ℃."
"This was a load pull-down test with a final temperature of 6 ℃ and an average initial temperature of 35 ℃, the comparison with and without phase change material."
"Consider the average of the pull-down time of the load temperature, the temperature in cabinet of refrigerator, the compressor run time, and the energy consumption."
"The results of the experiment found that the refrigerator with phase change material had a time to pull-down the load temperature of more than 3 minutes, accounting for 0.61 %, the increase is only slight and has no effect on the cooling system."
"The pull-down time of temperature in cabinet reduce up to 94 minutes, is 33.09 %."
The compressor operating time decreased by 88 minutes is 25.00 % and reduced energy consumption by 11.930 W is 17.77 %.
"When comparison without phase change material had a time to pull- down the load temperature of 485 minutes, the pull- down time of temperature in cabinet of 284 minutes, there was a compressor operating time of 352 minutes, and energy consumption by 67.131 W. The results indicate that the use of phase change materials has a positive impact on the cooling system."
