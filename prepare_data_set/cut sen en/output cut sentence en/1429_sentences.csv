"The objective of this research was to examine the effect of herp seasoning on physicochemical, antioxidative and sensory properties of seasoned crispy oyster mushroom by studying the drying of oyster mushrooms with a hot-air drier, and the physicochemical, antioxidative and sensory qualities of herb seasoning powders and herb flavored crispy oyster mushrooms."
"It was found that the mushroom drying at 70 ˚C by a hot-air drier provided a drying rate of 0.47 g/min, 11.54%yield, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity DPPH of 148.44 and 17.75 mg gallic acid equivalent per 100 g, respectively."
"There were 3 formulas of herbal flavors, namely sesame and pepper flavor, chilli paste flavor and Tom Yum flavor."
"The crispy mushroom Tom Yum flavor contained the highest phenolic compound content and DPPH antioxidant activity (160.05 and 17.35 mg gallic acid equivalent per 100 g, respectively) (p<0.05)."
"The suitable process of crispy oyster mushrooms with herbal flavors was a production process by drying oyster mushrooms at 70 ˚C for 3 hours, then frying and mixing with Tom Yum seasoning powder at a ratio of mushroom to seasoning powder as 5:1."
"The ingredients for Tom Yum seasoning powder were Chaya Spinash leaves, sugar, salt, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal and citric acid as 21.58%, 21.58%, 17.99%, 10.79%, 10.07%, 7.19%, 7.19% and 3.61%, respectively, with the most accepted by consumers."
