This paper presents axisymmetric free vibration behavior of semi liquid-containment toroidal shell with constraint volume condition using membrane theory.
Energy functional of the shell system can be derived by the principle of virtual work in terms of displacements and it is expressed in the appropriate forms.
Natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes can be calculated by finite element method with one-dimensional beam elements described in polar coordinate.
"The results indicate that the changing of bulk modulus of the internal liquid has a little effect on the frequency parameter of the shell structures with constraint volume condition, whereas effects of variations in thickness, cross-sectional radius, initial internal pressure, and elastic modulus have a major impact ones."
