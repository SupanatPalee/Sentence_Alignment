"This paper presents the voltage compensation and power factor improvement using Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), Static VAR Compensation (SVC) for single-phase power systems."
"The performance comparison of SVC with three control methods such as Voltage Control (VC) method, VAR Compensation Control (VCC) method, and Voltage and VAR Compensation Control (VVCC) method are proposed."
The design of SVC parameters depend on the mathematical model which is also presented in this paper.
"For performance testing, the hardware in the loop simulation technique using MATLAB/Simulink program and TMS320C2000TMExperimenter Kit DSP board are applied to Simulate voltage compensation and power factor improvement via the SVC."
The simulation results show that the SVC controlled by VVC and VVCC methods can provide similarly a good performance and better than VC method.
"However, the voltages at point of common coupling (PCC) and power factor values after compensation by three control methods."
