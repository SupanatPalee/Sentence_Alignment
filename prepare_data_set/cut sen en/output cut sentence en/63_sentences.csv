This paper presents a large displacement analysis of a toroidal dome structure having variable thickness under external pressure using differential geometry.
Membrane and flexural strain energies are defined in terms of metric tensor and curvature components.
"The energy functional of the toroidal dome structure under external pressure is derived from the principle of virtual work, and it is expressed in the appropriate forms."
Numerical results can be obtained by finite element method and iterative procedure.
"In this study, finite element model is simulated using one-dimensional beam elements via a fifth-order polynomial shape function, and it is divided along the meridian line."
The numerical results indicate that the displacement responses of the toroidal dome structure increase for larger external pressure.
The surface of the toroidal dome structure increases for a large value of the cross-sectional bend radii ratio.
Then the displacement responses increase under a large value of the cross-sectional bend radii ratio.
"In addition, the stiffness of the toroidal dome structure decreases if the cross-sectional radius-to-wall thickness ratios increase."
"Therefore, the displacement responses increase under a large value of the cross-sectional radius to wall thickness ratio."
