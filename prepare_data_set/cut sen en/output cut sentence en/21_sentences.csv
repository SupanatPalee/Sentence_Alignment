Foot and mouth disease is a contagious disease of animals.
It was found that it spreads out in the late rainy season and the early winter in every year.
"It is caused by seven aphthoviruses: A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and Asia 1."
"In Thailand, only three aphthoviruses was found (i.e., A, O and Asia 1)."
"These viruses were found in the secretions, milk and semen of the infected animals."
"Since the pandemic is significant, we studied the problems from the reports of the pandemic of the foot and mouth disease from 2013–2022, analyzed and searched for the solutions by creating the mathematical model(s) of the foot and mouth disease, finding the balance point(s) of the model(s), considering the numerical results and identifying the conditions of the stability(ies) of disease free equilibrium state and disease endemic equilibrium state."
The results were shown in the form of basic reproductive numbers.
The numerical results were analyzed for controlling the disease and providing the guidelines for reducing the pandemic of the foot and mouth disease.
