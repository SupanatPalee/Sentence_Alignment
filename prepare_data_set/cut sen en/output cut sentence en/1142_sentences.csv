This research is aimed to develop the horizontal animal feed mixer with 2-stage.
The 350 liters mixer was powered by electric motor 2 HP.
The outer-screw mixer with left and right spiral blade has the diameter of 680 mm.
and a pitch of 195 mm..
The inner-screw mixer with right and left spiral blade has the diameter of 480 mm.
and a pitch of 195 mm..
"The testing for mixing 0.2 m3 of rice husk 22.11% MC with 5,000 plastic beads in 5 mm."
"diameter was set at 3 different speed by 6, 12 and 18 rpm."
"The samples were collected at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 and 360 seconds, respectively."
"The results showed that the coefficient of variation is greatest at agitator rotation speed of 18 rpm, 28.6% of moisture at 210 seconds."
The best performance was 0.343 m3/hr (343 litres/hr).
The payback period of the feed mixer was 0.99 months.
