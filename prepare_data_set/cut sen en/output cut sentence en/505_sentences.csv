The purpose of this research was to develop a mathematical model for selecting the working fluids of the heat pump system for medium-temperature drying applications.
"In this study, seven variables consisted of (1) Mass of refrigerant per unit heat output (MPH), (2) Vapor volume flow rate, (3) Displacement volume, (4) Discharge pressure, (5) Discharge temperature, (6) Pressure ratio, and (7) Coefficient of performance of heat pump ."
These variables were used to compare 15 substances used in the heat pump systems.
"The results showed that when the condenser temperature increased, the variables (1) to (6) tended to increase with the difference in temperature and pressure."
"As for variable (7), it tends to decrease with increasing temperature and pressure on the condenser."
"Moreover, the results showed that when the environmental impact of both low ozone depletion potential (ODP), low global warming potential (GWP), as well as safety (non-flammable and non-toxic) of use is considered."
R-1234ze(E) was found to be the most suitable substance because it has the least impact on the environment and has a high  Â compared to other substances.
"Then, followed by R-1234yf, R-1234ze(Z), R-1233zd(E), R-290, R-600, R-245ca, R-245fa, and R-236fa, respectively."
