"The objective of this research was to develop chili-mulberry sauce mixed with Ladyfinger banana (MSL) to satisfy consumers, as required by community enterprises."
"The effect of the quantity and/or types of ingredients on chemical and physical properties, and sensory evaluation of MSL was studied."
"It was revealed that ingredients of 12.15% fresh red Chi Fah chili, 2.70% fresh Kra Liang chili, 12.15% dried red Chi Fah chili, 10% sugar, 16% vinegar, 5% garlic, 4% salt, 9.35% Ladyfinger banana and 28.6% mulberry juice were appropriate to produce MSL."
"The amount of modified tapioca starch (MTS) and xanthan gum (XG), 0.03% and 0.05%, respectively were sufficient to improved viscosity and stability of MSL product."
The sensory acceptance was evaluated between like moderately to like very much (7.12-7.73) by 80general consumers and could be kept at least 12 weeks.
The total solid was not significantly different (24.51-24.68%).
"The pH and total acidity were between 3.86-3.90 and 1.16-1.19%, respectively."
The antioxidant capacity (DPPH) and total phenolic content gradually increased during 6-week storage and then decreased until 12-week storage while anthocyanin continuously decreased during 12-week storage.
The color explained as L* and a* were likely to decrease while b* was likely to increase.
"During 12-week storage, layer separation was not found and there were less of total microorganisms, yeasts and molds and E. coli than those of Thai specified standard."
