"This research aims to study and improve the hydraulic high pressure biomass briquetting machine for making biomass without binder for use as solid fuel, by studying the physical characteristics of the obtained biomass briquettes, temperature, time of charcoal pyrolysis from biomass, including the type of biomass that is suitable for the machine produced from the research."
Which these raw materials will be briquetted without using a binder with high pressure biomass briquetting machine with hydraulic system for pressing the biomass without binder for use as solid fuel.
"With a diameter of 3cm, it was found that the pineapple leaf scraps left from the fiber production process were able to apply higher pressure than Napier grass, coconut fiber, sugarcane bagasse and acacia pods were 80, 70, 60, 50 and 50 bar, respectively."
The optimum time and temperature in this study was 30 min and 400oC.
"The heat value at pressure 50 bar of briquette charcoalÂ  from pineapple leaf scraps had the highest heating values, compared to Pineapple leaf scraps using latex glue as a binder (20%by weight), Napier grass crushed, coconut fiber, sugarcane bagasse, and acacia pods were 31.92, 24.81, 28.57, 25.75, 24.57 and 20.75 MJ/kg, respectively, when comparing the heating value of biomass and charcoal from this research with other studies, and It was found that the values are similar."
"Therefore, the hydraulic high pressure biomass briquetting machine for making biomass without binder for use as solid fuel is suitable and can be used as a tool to generate energy sources because of the reduction time, saves energy and costs that occur in the process."
