"Area of mangrove forests in Thailand has considerably decreased because the mangrove forests have been destroyed to use the land for other purposes, e.g."
aquaculture.
"Even though there have been reforestation campaigns, the effectiveness of the reforestation is still very low because the rate of survival of the mangrove sprouts is very low."
"This research focuses on the effect of flooded level, which is one of the important factors influencing on the physical characteristics of mangrove sprouts."
Experiment was conducted in a big plastic tank.
"Inside the tank there were three steps for simulating the mangrove sprouts planting with two types of mangroves sprouts, Avicennia alba and Rhizophora apiculate, plated with three different flooded levels – 70, 35 and 15 cm."
"To simulate tide, every day water was pumped into the tank, then immersed the sprouts for three hours, and was finally pumped."
The experiment was continued for 67 days.
"After test, the changes of the physical characteristics of each sprout were determined."
"The results showed that at the flooded level 70 cm., the sprout grew the least."
"In addition, Avicennia alba sprouts were more durable to flooding than Rhizophora apiculate."
