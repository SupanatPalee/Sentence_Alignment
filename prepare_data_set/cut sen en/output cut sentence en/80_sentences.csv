Coral reefs are an important coastal ecosystem in terms of biological and economic points of view.
They are vulnerable to both environment change and resource utilization.
"Therefore, continuous monitoring is necessary for applying the appropriate management."
"However, the in-situ coral reefs standard method survey is expensive and time-consuming."
This study presents the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel-2 satellite data with a minimum distance classification technique to map coral reefs.
Ground truth data for satellite data training and validating was collected using drones.
Coral reefs at Rawai beach are classified using this method as 348 rai.
The total accuracy of classification is 71% and the kappa coefficient is 0.57.
"The accuracy of individual classification of sand, coral, and sandy coral is 86.2%, 68.8%, and 58.6%, respectively."
