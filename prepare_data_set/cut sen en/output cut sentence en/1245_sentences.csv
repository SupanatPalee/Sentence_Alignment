This paper presents the results of Shear Strength evaluation in hard clay subsoil with Kunzelstab Penetration Test (KPT).
The results of the KPT will be compared with the standard penetration test (SPT).
The results showed that the prediction of the soil layer characteristics from KPT shows the characteristics of the soil layer that is more stiffness than the prediction  of results from SPT  at the same depth.
The relationship between the standard penetration test (NSPT) and the Kunzelstab Penetration Test (NKPT) both in the without corrected (N) and corrected value (N¢) tends to be consistent.
"In addition, relationships between NSPT and NKPT in the form of linear equations."
The comparison of the application of KPT and SPT  results in shallow foundation designs showed the consistent results.
