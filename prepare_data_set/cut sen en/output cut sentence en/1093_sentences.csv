This research aims to apply ABC classification and cost ratio analysis to ready mixed concrete machine spare parts in Thailand.
Considering the goal to prevent unplanned machine breakdown caused of the lack of spare parts stored in the plant.
Starting from a survey of spare parts data of concrete mixer machines.
Select most of the machine sizes and brands to assume the scope of the study.
Evaluate the worthiness of machine spare parts by finding the damage cost in case of no spare parts in store compared with inventory cost.
Expectations of the study will provide the benefit of classifying spare parts that are worthwhile for the concrete batching plant that should be kept in storage.
"The result of the study found 52 machine spare parts have a cost ratio over 1.00, which is recommended spare parts for keep in the concrete batching plant spare part store and a guideline for applying to other sizes of machines, including other engineering machineries such as automobile repair shops, packing machine or agricultural machine, etc."
