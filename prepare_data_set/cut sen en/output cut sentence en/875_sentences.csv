The objectives of this research article were: 1) to analyze the problems in the garment production process within the textile industry; and 2) to reduce the production processes and time in order to be more efficient.
This study focused on the polo shirt production process.
"It used the fishbone diagram to analyze and find the causes of the problems relating to the 7 wastes, and the process flow chart to analyze the value of activities within the production process."
Lean manufacturing concepts and ECRS principles were used to improve the production process by eliminating unnecessary processes and combining some processes.
"Comparative results of the production process before and after the improvement found that the cycle time in the production process was reduced from 5 hours 46 minutes to 4 hours 48 minutes, with the production process reduced by 8 steps, resulting in a more efficient production process (16.76%)."
