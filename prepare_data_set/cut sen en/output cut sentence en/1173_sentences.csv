Construction activities including repair and renovation is a work that produces dust which dust is air pollution that affects human health when particulate matter entering the respiratory system causing irritation and damage to the tissues of that organ such as lung tissue.
"This research therefore developed a personal dust detector for construction worker or renovation of the building which the developed equipment must be suitable for use, cheaper than the equipment that is sold in general and equipment can alert the operator to leave the area with dust beyond the standard value."
"The research work begins with studying the current dust and dust measurement devices then design and develop a personal dust detector for construction activities, based on the strength and price of the equipment so the developed device was tested compared to the standard dust survey device."
"According to the Pollution Control Department has an average of 24 hours of dust, must not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter."
The findings indicated that the prototype device developed to measure the dust when compared to standard dust measuring devices and can alert the operator which can prevent construction workers or improve the construction from dust that exceeds the standard value in the construction work site and is cheaper than the equipment that is sold in general.
