This paper presents the laboratory development of the course of data communication using the outcome-based learning.
The objective of this paper is to make the engineering students understand the sequence and procedure of basic data communication that is the basic concept for the course of computer network and administration.
Packet sniffer in real time is a tool used in order to sniff the data from application used including with the standard format of data frame in traffic through the internet.
"Moreover, network simulator is used for a small network to make students understand the necessary parameters such as IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and DNS server, that students can apply to connect and set up the network in daily life."
Development of laboratory course design shows that students can see the data flow of data communication.
The learning outcome evaluation in laboratory shows that the number of student’s score more than 50% is increased in data communication course and class average of the course of computer network and administration is higher than last year.
Results show that the development of laboratory content is the foundation of knowledge for learning advanced courses.
