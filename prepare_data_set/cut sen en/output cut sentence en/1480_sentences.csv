This research aimed to determine the suitable amount of coatings in fiber coating from banana sheath for use in handicrafts.
The studied factors were two species of banana trees namely Gros Michel Banana and Cultivated banana.
"The amount of micro wax was studied in three levels which were 0%, 50%, and 100% of paraffin wax weight."
"The test plan was Factorial in CRD, which resulted in a total of 6 treatments."
"The research was to select suitable treatment by scanning the surface characteristics with a scanning electron microscope and studying the color, maximum tensile force, and moisture content."
"The research results were found that fiber from banana sheath that was coated with micro wax, 100% weight of paraffin wax was suitable for use in handicrafts."
"The product was light yellow, had a brightness value (L*) of 63.92, a maximum tensile strength value of 100.73 N, an elongation of 8.33%, and a moisture content of 4.98%."
The characteristics of the coated fibers were evenly smooth across the entire strand.
