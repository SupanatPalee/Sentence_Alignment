The preliminary phytochemical research of biological activities and antioxidants in stink bean (Parkia  speciosa Hassk.)
"peel extracted by maceration extraction with four organic solvents, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol."
"The extracts of stink bean peels were found to include nine classes of significant phytochemical compounds which were alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoid, coumarin, saponins, tannins, terpenoid, steroid, and cardiac glycosides."
"The total phenolic content of stink bean peel extracted with ethanol was recorded to be the greatest, followed by ethyl acetate dichloromethane and hexane with equilibrium values of 646.83±27.72, 137.82±5.84, 7.15±0.26 and 4.14±0.09 mg GAE/g FW respectively."
"The antioxidant activity using the DPPH radical scavenging method showed the highest percentage of radical scavenging record in the stink bean peel extracted with ethanol (50.6±1.51 – 63.38±0.71) followed by the stink bean peel extracted with dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and hexane respectively."
"In addition, ethanol-extracted stink bean peel was exhibited highest antioxidant activity by showing the lowest IC50 value of 0.66±0.05, 0.14±0.002, 0.033±0.001, 0.023±0.002 and 0.019±0.001 µg/ml at 5, 20, 30, 40 and 60 min respectively."
This corresponds to the greatest total phenolic content in stink bean peel extracted using ethanol.
It demonstrates that the stink bean peel is a promising plant that can be further researched and developed to be a key ingredient in skin-beneficial cosmetic products.
