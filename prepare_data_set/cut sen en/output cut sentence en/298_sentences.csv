Cellular lightweight concrete is produced by uniform distribution of air bubbles made from preformed foam throughout the mass of concrete in substitution of coarse aggregates.
"The properties of cellular lightweight concrete are depended on density or foam volume, when the concrete hardens was to become pore system inside."
"That, it is a very significant characteristic affects to strength, durability and thermal conductivity."
"This paper presents the effect of foaming agent types to air void size of cellular lightweight concrete with a wet density of 1,800 kg/m3 using sand to cement ratios of 2:1 and water to cement ratios of 0.45."
"At this density, the concrete specimens were used three types of foaming agent and used three different foaming agents to water ratios of 1:20, 1:30 and 1:40."
To producing preformed foam by foam generator used pressure at 5.50 kg/cm2 and the concrete specimens were used air dry curing method for 28 days.
It was found that median air void sizes are mainly in the range of 50-450 microns.
"Foaming agent A was found median air void sizes between 50-250 microns, foaming agent B was median air void sizes between 50-450 microns and foaming agent C was median air void sizes between 100-450 microns."
"Although, foaming agents used the same process to produce preformed foam but it’s caused to make a difference on air void sizes."
"That’s depend on performance of foaming agents, in addition the different foaming agents to water ratios has impacted on air void sizes and air void size distributions that effects on compressive strength of cellular lightweight concrete."
"Thus, before using foaming agents to produce should be test for finding proportion foaming agents."
