The use of agricultural biomass as raw material for activated carbon production has been increasing because it is cheap and largely generated amount.
The produced activated carbon was useful for remove the pollutants from aqueous media.
This work aims to study the effects of temperature and time on the activated carbon production from coconut coir obtained from Chonburi province.
The experiments were divided into two stages: (i) biochar production and (ii) activated carbon production.
The results revealed that both temperature and operation time had the significant effects on solid yield and surface area of Biochar.
"After that, the biochar obtained from different conditions were activated by using 4M KOH, 4M H3PO4 and 4M H2SO4 at the desired temperatures and operating time to produce activated carbon."
"The results showed that biochar which was produced at 500 oC and 1 h, then activated by KOH at 200 oC and 2 h provided the activated carbons with the highest surface area of 1,147.74 m2/g."
"In addition, the Methylene Blue adsorption was found to follow the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.9993)."
The overall experimental results revealed that activated carbon produced from coconut coir could be operated under lower temperature and exhibited opportunity and possibility to design the cheap and uncomplicated kiln.
The production energy can be reduced.
"Moreover, the production cost for activated carbon was presented that it was lower than that of commercial activated carbon."
"Therefore, it probably had an opportunity for commercial business competition or further development to new products for pollutant adsorption and other proposes."
