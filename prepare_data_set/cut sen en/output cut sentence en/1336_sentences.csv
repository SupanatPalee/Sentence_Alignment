"ABSTRACT In the Big City, the need of underground area has been increasing."
That is the reason why people need to improve the retraining wall system to be more efficient.
There are many usages of technics how to reduce wall movement.
This research was the study of T-shape arrangement of sheet pile wall in the physical model using sand as the soil sample which has 29.9o of internal friction angle.
"We used the different length of web: 5, 10, 15 centimeters installed behind of the excavation side."
The increases of soil resistance and area moment of inertia affected the movement behavior in each length of web.
"We found that the T-shape with the web longer than the failure area of active resisting zone, it could develop more the moving resistance and reduce movement more effectively than the sheet pile with the web placed in the active resisting zone."
