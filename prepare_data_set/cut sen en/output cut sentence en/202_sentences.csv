This article presents a meshless method called Differential Quadrature Method for solving the Poisson problems.
"Solving the Poisson problem is one of the important steps for calculating flow dynamics, electric field, and heat transfer."
This method estimates the derivatives directly so there is no need to deal with integration process.
The selected Poisson’s problems were analyzed in a unit square domain.
The numerical solutions were compared with the analytical solutions in five cases.
The overall error in all cases were less than one percent.
