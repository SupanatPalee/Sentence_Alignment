This research aims to evaluate an appropriate empirical thin layer mathematical model for the moisture ratio of paddy prediction in drying process with a pneumatic dryer.
A 20 kg of paddy with initial moisture content 26%w.b.
was used as a sample in this experiment.
The drying process were tested at drying air temperature 70ºC and 80ºC under condition of paddy feed rate 8.45 kg/min and drying air flow rate of 0.0631 m3/s (constant throughout the experiment).
"The result found that Midilli s’ model was most suitable for predicting the drying characteristics of paddy by a pneumatic dryer under drying air temperature conditions, 70ºC and 80ºC when compared to the other empirical models in this study."
"The highest R2 of prediction from Midilli s’ model is 0.999 and 0.998 for drying at 70ºC and 80ºC, respectively and the lowest RMSE is 0.0083 and 0.0115 for drying at 70ºC and 80ºC, respectively."
