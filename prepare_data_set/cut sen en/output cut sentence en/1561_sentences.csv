"In This research, we determined vitamin C in fruit juice using amperometry at glassy carbon working electrode."
The mechanism of electrochemical oxidation of vitamin C was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in various pH 4 to 8 of phosphate buffers.
"The result showed that the optimum pH of an electrolyte solution is phosphate buffer pH 6, that appears oxidation peak at 0.44 V with scan rate 0.1 V/s using cyclic voltammetric detection."
Amperometric technique was used for vitamin C quantitative by stirring throughout the experiment with optimum potential of 0.5 V. It displayed a wide dynamic calibration range 10 to 266 µM with high sensitivity of 4.78 µA/mM.
"The limit of detection and limit of quantification are 1.39 µM and 4.62 µM, respectively."
"Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to analyze ascorbic acid in fruit juice samples of fresh lemon juice and 100% orange juice box."
They exhibited a reasonable relative of the percent recovery in the range of 80–97.
