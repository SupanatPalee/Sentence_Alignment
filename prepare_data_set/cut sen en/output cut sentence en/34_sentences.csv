"This paper presents the study of air quality effect from particulate matter with diameter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), total volatile organic compound (TVOC) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) for indoor and outdoor Department of Electronics Technology, Ramkhamhaeng University, Bangkok."
By creating a device detect air quality for the period from November 2020 to March 2021.
"From the results, It was found that the average PM2.5 of 24-hour continuous is 31.50  for the inside office (good level), 38.24  for the inside building (moderate level) and 44.80  for the outside building (moderate level)."
"The average TVOC of 8-hour continuous is 0.58  for the inside office (good level), 0.32  for the inside building (good level) and 0.41  for the outside building (good level)."
"The average CO2-eq of 24-hour continuous is 1122.73  for the inside office, 983.97  for the inside building and 922.88  for the outside building."
