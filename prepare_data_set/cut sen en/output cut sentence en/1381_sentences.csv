"Previously, the architecture and preliminary testing of MARS (Mahanakorn Satellite Receiving Station) were presented in Part-I article [1]."
The real-time broadcasting images taken by Earth Observing Satellites (EOS) in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) were used for multiple purposes in GI (Geographic Information) applications.
The continuing phase presented in this academic article is the practical operations of MARS and production of in-house GI.
The MARS has capability to track and receive the series of NASA’s EOS and NOAA’s EOS.
"In the practical operations, several passed over Thailand of satellite images are used for disaster monitoring every year, and hotspots location which caused bushfire in the northern part."
The GI products are posted on MUT facebook account for public services.
