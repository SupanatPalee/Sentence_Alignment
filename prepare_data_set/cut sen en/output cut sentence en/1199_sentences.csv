"This paper, the friction behavior of contaminated lubricants at different loads and differentcontaminant concentrationshasbeenstudied."
The experimental equipment wasdesignedtohavetwo sets of the steel wheel of 5.2 cm in diameter.
"The first wheel was rotated at a constant speedof about 1,450 RPM."
"The angular velocity of the other wheel couldbe adjustedfor testingthe slideto roll ratio (SRR) at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5."
Both wheels were set up to be parallel and contactedtogether under an applied load.
"The applied load was varied to be 3 kgf, 5 kgf, 7 kgf, and 9 kgf.Thus, the friction of the lubricant film at the junction zone of both wheels can be evaluated."
"Thesix samples (engine oil + water, engine oil + diesel fuel, engine oil + carbon, engine oil + metals (Fe), engine oil and engine oil used) were provided for testing."
The experimental results showedthat the lubricant contaminated with water was influent to the viscosity property and the frictioncoefficient more than other factors.
"Furthermore, it is found that the friction coefficient is smallestin the case of the pure rolling contact (SRR=0) and then it is dramatically increased when theSRR is increased."
