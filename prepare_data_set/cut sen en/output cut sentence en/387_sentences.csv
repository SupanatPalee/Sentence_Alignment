"Diversity of aquatic insects along with the water quality in Rama Public Park, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya province were examined 10 sites from June 2017 to April 2018."
"A total of 1,041 individuals in 22 families and 4 orders of aquatic insects were found in this study."
"The order Hemiptera had the highest number of families (7 families), followed by order Odonata (6 families), Coleoptera (5 families), Diptera (4 families)."
"Physico-chemical water quality parameter at each site, such as total dissolved solids, biochemical oxygen demand and conductivity were significantly different (P<0.05)."
Most of physico-chemical water quality parameters in Rama Public Park were in class 3 and 4 of the Classification and Standards of Water of Thailand for agriculture.
The correlation between physicochemical water quality parameters and aquatic insects were analyzed.
"The physico-chemical parameters, such as, water and air temperature, turbidity, BOD, pH and conductivity were significantly correlated with Coenagrionidae, Notonectidae, Dytiscidae, Corduliidae, Protoneuridae and Naucoridae (P<0.05)."
Assessment of water quality could lead to an administrative planning and management of water resources in the Rama Public Park.
Promoting conservation of water resources should be emphasized.
