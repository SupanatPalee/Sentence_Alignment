"This paper presents the development of special laboratory course on Embedded Systems for Mechatronics and Automation Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology for innovation-based learning through Mini-Project."
It can used for real benefit in the community.
Lecturer Â have set topics for problems from the community.
"Then students divide into groups, Brainstorm creativity, Design, budgeting and create innovations that can be used in practice at the front of the M-Shop, Pramandanijjanukroah School."
Satisfaction survey of 45 students found that this innovation is useful and can actually educate 100 percent and students interested in embedded systems and wanting to learn about AI 75.56 percent.
"In developing teaching and learning, teachers divided teaching groups into 2 groups comparing between group A using Input Based Education (IBE) and group B using innovation-based learning through Mini-Project."
By focus on developing Hard Skills and Soft Skills for learners.
"As a result, the learners had a score of 78.3% for their cognitive skills and 91.16% for their Soft Skills."
"As a result, the development of learners is in the course of study according to the Thailand Qualification Framework (TQF)."
"As for the traditional teaching, the score was 33.3% for their cognitive skills and 45% for their Soft Skills, resulting in not all aspects of the development of learners according to the TQF."
Too much intelligence to the point that the learners are not involved and have unqualified learning outcomes.
