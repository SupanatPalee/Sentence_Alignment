The objective of this research was to examine the strength characteristics of prefabricated beam-floor components constructed using composite materials that combine wood and reinforced concrete.
"Furthermore, the aim was to enhance these components to make them more suitable for construction purposes."
"There are four styles of T-beam composite materials combining wood and reinforced concrete: Style 1 is the reinforced concrete T-beam(TB-RC), Style 2 is the T-beam composite material (TB-C-N) with wood and reinforced concrete connected using nail, Style 3 is the T-beam composite material (TB-C-GN) with wood and reinforced concrete connected using nail grooving, and Style 4 is the T-beam composite material (TB-C-GR) with wood and reinforced concrete connected at the ring grooving joint."
The laboratory conducted a test on T-beams to assess their bending behavior using 4-point test.
The objective was to compare the results with reinforced concrete T-beams (TB-RC).
"The findings indicated that the moment-resistance efficiency, when compared to TB-RC, was 6.20, 31.79, and 42.47 at the L/240 bending distance (10 mm), and 28.87, 51.76, and 86.76 at the L/120 bending distance (20 mm) for TB-C-N beams, TB-C-GN, and TB-C-GR, respectively."
"The moment-resistance efficiencies were roughly similar between TB-C-GN and TB-C-GR but significantly higher than TB-C-N. Additionally, it was observed that the strain values across the entire depth of the beam cross-section remained linear both before and after loading at various locations."
