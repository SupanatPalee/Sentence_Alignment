The aim of this article is to experimentally investigate the forming and properties of the geo-polymer material by using powder coating sludge and Indian kaolin.
The powder coating sludge is a waste from powder coating production process and it was XRF tested to find ingredients of element.
"The mixture ratios of Indian kaolin and powder coating sludge were 66.7:33.3, 60:40, and 55:45, respectively."
"The concentrations of sodium hydroxide solution were 5, 10, and 15 mol/L, respectively and concentrations of sodium hydroxide to concentration of sodium silicate solution were 1:1.64, 1:2.46, and 1:3.28, respectively."
Specimens were formed according to each mixture and concentration.
"Then, some properties such as compressive strength, coefficient of thermal conductivity, and water absorbing were standardized tested."
"It was found that the mixture ratios of Indian kaolin and powder coating sludge of 66.70:33.30, concentration of sodium hydroxide solution of 10 mol/L and concentration of sodium hydroxide to concentration of sodium silicate solution of 1:2.46 was the highest compressive strength as 4.07 MPa."
Because the proportion of Indian kaolin was directly varied the ingredient of silica and alumina therefore the high proportion of Indian kaolin caused the high compressive strength.
"Moreover, the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the highest compressive strength was 0.0892 W/ (mâ€¢k)."
"In addition, the lowest of water absorbing was 24.20 %."
"Finally, the results illustrated that powder coating sludge can replace other engineering materials especially construction and insulation materials because of its high compressive strength and low coefficient of thermal conductivity."
