The improvement of hydrophilic properties have an impact to increase adhesives properties of silicon surface for photovoltaic could protect the moisture into the cell.
"In this research, the optimization of a low-pressure high-frequency plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) system was studied an effect of a mixture of Argon and Nitrogen gas flow rates for hydrophilic characteristic."
"The three parameter with the time for plasma treatment, radio frequency (RF) power and a mixture of Argon and Nitrogen flow rates was investigated for propose system."
The improved adhesive property of the surface was confirmed by using contact angle meter for measured the hydrophilic properties.
"It was found that the optimize parameters for the surface plasma treatment was 300 W RF power and 10 min on plasma treatment time, respectively The Argon and Nitrogen gas flow rate were 10.0 L/min and 0.4 L/min."
It was also confirmed that the contact angle decreased from 35.9 to 12.8 degree.
The nitrogen radicals react to silicon surface results in surface modification and therefore the adhesive property improved.
