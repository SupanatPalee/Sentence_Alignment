The paper presents a wind power generator from an evaporative cooling system by wind turbine generator system.
"Generally, the output power of wind turbines extracted from wind energy depends on wind speed in which the characteristic is non-linear."
Only one operating point providing the maximum power is available.
"Therefore, the maximum power point tracking control is important."
The proposed technique will show that the maximum power can be obtained.
The simulation and experiment are used to study and develop the maximum power point tracking algorithm.
Hardware experimental results from prototype are presented to verify performance of the proposed power generation from evaporative cooling system.
