"The objective of this research was to study on drying kinetic, total color difference of mango before and after drying, before and after drying, specific energy consumption, water activity and shrinkage."
"The Nam Dok Mai mangoes were dried with hot air at 2 m/s, temperature of 50, 60, 70 °C and hot air at 70 °C in combination with a microwave with a power of 700 watts."
The study found that increasing drying temperature results in faster drying of mangoes.
"As a result, the drying time and the specific energy consumption are reduced."
"Drying mangoes with hot air at 70 °C took the shortest drying time of 320 minutes, total color difference of mango before and after drying was minimal (∆E=6.08), specific energy consumption was lowest at 478.73 MJ/kgevaporated water, The smallest shrinkage at 79.77% and water activity was 0.516, which was within the dry food standard."
Comparison between drying of mangoes with hot air at 70 °C and drying by combined drying technique with hot air at 70 °C and microwave at 700 watts.
"It was found that drying by combined technique had shorter the drying time by 3.12%, the color difference before and after drying was reduced by 40.30%, specific energy consumption was reduced by 36.7%, shrinkage decreased by 11.12% and water activity was 0.505, which was within the dry food standard."
