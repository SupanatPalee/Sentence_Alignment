An investigation of the heat transfer characteristics of the staggered economizers with inline and staggered tube banks has been conducted.
"Experiments were performed at air flow rates of 489 kg/hr, 548 kg/hr, 602 kg/hr, 660 kg/hr, and 713 kg/hr, and water flow rates of 1,000 l/hr, 2,000 l/hr, 3,000 l/hr, and 4,000 l/hr."
"Experimental results revealed that a staggered heat exchanger with a 3-mm fin spacing (St = 53.7 mm, SD = 60.04 mm) yielded a maximum efficiency of 0.393."
