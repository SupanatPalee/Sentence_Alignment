The objectives of this study were to study and determine the importance level of factors related to the selection and evaluation service providers in machine procurement and fabrication by applying analytic hierarchy process (AHP).
The research methodology began with studying and collecting data to determine factors affecting the selection and evaluation service provider from related literatures and experts in manufacturing industry.
"Five main factors that were determined included price, production capability, delivery, quality and time."
"In addition, twenty minor factors were identified."
"Then, questionnaire was developed theoretically based on AHP principle."
Data were collected from interviewing ten experts and then analyzed by using Expert Choice v.11.
"The results indicated that time ranked the first priority of importance (0.482) followed by quality (0.288), production capability (0.136), price (0.062) and delivery (0.032), respectively."
"For overall factors consideration at sub-factor level, the top five of sub-factors were on-time delivery (0.244) followed by product quality (0.178), price quotation (0.115), production time (0.106) and industrial knowledge and know-how (0.065), respectively."
