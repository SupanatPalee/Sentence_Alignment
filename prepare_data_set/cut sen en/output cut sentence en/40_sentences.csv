Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication.
It results in language and speech disorders.
"Some autistic people may not speak at all, some imitate, and others speak their own language."
This impedes the ability to communicate their own needs to others.
"Although cure for autism remains unknown, therapy can help develop skills and learning for them, leading to better well-being and quality of life."
"At Autism Research Center, Khon Kaen University, flash cards with pictures, books, and teaching slides have been used to improve speaking competency, but the children have not been satisfactorily interested in them."
"Today, communication disabilities are being widely treated by using mobile applications or games."
Appropriate interaction is the key to the success of this therapy.
"Therefore, this paper presents a mobile sound interaction technique for people with autism."
Developers could shorten their development time by following the proposed framework guideline to select the right interaction.
"To confirm the effectiveness, this research developed a game called “Run animal Run” by using the presented interaction framework and interactive multimedia, and then the game is employed with the volunteers at Autism Research Center, Khon Kaen University."
The results showed that volunteers were able to interact with Run Animal Run game by using the designed interactions.
This game help stimulating interest and improving their language skills.
