This research paper presents the development of a small betta aquaculture system.
The purpose of this research is to reduce water-changing and food-feeding time by using the open-source robotic arm with the designed equipment.
The development consists of 2 parts: 1) the designing of water- changing and the food-feeding equipment.
and 2) the software enhancements to control the robot arm to move more accurately.
"There are three case studies: Case 1 to test the accuracy of horizontal motion, Case 2 to test the functionality of the water-changing and food-feeding equipment, and Case 3 to test the overall functionality."
The test results show the command and position control performance as well as the integration with the developed equipment which can work according to the specified conditions.
