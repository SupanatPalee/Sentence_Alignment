"Three solvents including water, hexane and acetone were used to pretreat cassava rhizome."
The pretreated biomass samples had lower extractives content compared to the non-extracted one.
"The pretreated samples together with the original biomass were fast pyrolysed in a fluidised bed reactor producing bio-oil, char and gas."
"The results showed that after extraction with water, hexane and acetone, the yields of total bio-oil, heavy bio-oil and gas increased at the expense of light bio-oil and char yields."
A maximum total bio-oil yield of 54 wt% was achieved when using water as solvent.
"Based on the property analyses, all solvents hardly affect the pH, solids content, ash content and density of bio-oils."
"However, hexane and acetone could increase the bio-oil heating value."
"In addition, the flash point, fire point, hydrogen and oxygen contents were increased by the solvent extraction, whereas the carbon content of bio-oil reduced except when using acetone."
