Cellular lightweight concrete is mortar mixed with preserved air bubbles or foam liquid distributed in concrete instead of coarse aggregate in order to reduce the concrete unit weight.
The properties of cellular lightweight concrete vary with unit weights.
Concrete with great amount of bubbles given high porous and light weight provides low thermal conductivity.
Cellular lightweight concrete with unit weights of 1600 and 1800 kilograms per cubic meter using water to cement ratio of 0.45 and 0.55 and sand to cement ratio of 2:1 and 3:1 were designed and produced for the study of thermal conductivity and the remained compressive strength after heating at various temperatures.
"The results are as follows: (1) the thermal conductivity coefficient ranged from 0.164 to 0.255 watts per meter Kelvin and (2) the average remained compressive strength after heating at temperature of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 degrees are approximately 91, 76, 52, 28 and 17 percent, respectively."
