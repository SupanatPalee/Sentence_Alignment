This study aimed at developing the warp yarn adjustment to increase the efficiency of silk weaving process efficiency of the silk weaving group in Surin province.
The cause and effect diagram was used as research instrument to analyze the problems and the causes of the problem.
The Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) was used as instrument for sorting the important level of causes of problems.
"The ECRS (Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, Simplify) technique was used as tool for developing the warp yarn adjustment."
The result of the warp yarn adjustment assessment showed that the low efficiency of the warp yarn caused by the inappropriate working mechanism and unbalanced of the yarn tension.
The result of the developing of the warp yarn adjusting device showed that it reduced time for warp yarn adjustment at 121.45 seconds for each adjustment.
The efficiency of the warp yarn adjustment increased for 71.53 percent and the tilt of the silk thread was reduced to 22.04 centimeters which could help reducing the warp yarn wasting for 403.2 meters and it was 97.39 percent per 10 sets of silk woven.
