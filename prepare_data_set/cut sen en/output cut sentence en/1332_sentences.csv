"Literature review it found that neural networks have been applied in industrial and in various fields such as production design, production planning and production schedules, etc."
In this article was shown that the applications of neural network monitor and quality assurance of production in manufacturing.
"There was many methods integrate of neural network with other method such as Taguchi, Genetic Algorithm."
It was for improving the efficiency and increase the accuracy of neural networks.
"In this article, there separated four characteristics of quality were quality control statistics, classification quality of products, forecast quality of products and testing and efficiency improvement of the product."
