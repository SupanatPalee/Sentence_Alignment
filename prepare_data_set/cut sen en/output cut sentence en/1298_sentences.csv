This article is an analysis of the energy and exergy of mango drying using a solar tunnel dryer with forced convection.
The experiment was conducted to find the Energy Utilization Ratio (EUR) of the dryer and apply the second law of thermodynamics in the analysis of the exergy on the solar collector and the solar tunnel dryer including the ability to evaporate water from the product to the energy of the drying process.
The results obtained from the energy and exergy analyzes could be used to develop the potential of the renewable energy drying system in terms of maximum efficiency.
