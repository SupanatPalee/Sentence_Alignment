"This research has three objectives as follows, first, to study the characteristics of the ceramic souvenir product designs in Ban Taohai, Phitsanulok; second, to design new souvenir products that reflect the Ban Taohai identity; and third, to evaluate the newly developed ceramic souvenir products."
This research started with the analysis and synthesis of data from related previous research regarding Ban Taohai pottery products.
The study then developed a concept for a process of designing the ceramic souvenir products.
The evaluation of the ceramic product design was conducted together with 11 experts.
The results of their evaluation were as follows.
"First, Ban Taohai pottery products included stoneware mixed with gravel and sand, and the clay used can be gray, brown, and red colors."
"They were decorated with geometric shapes pattern using pressing, scratching, rolling, and molding and pasting techniques."
"The use of these techniques, together with dark brown to black glazing, made the Ban Taohai pottery products more unique and outstanding."
"Second, the ceramic souvenir design that was developed by adopting the concept of Ban Taohai unique patterns resulted in 6 patterns of low relief decoration (“อุ” shape."
"Third, the evaluation of the new ceramic souvenir product design, which has 6 patterns, was rated as “highly appropriate level” with an average score at 3.65-4.00."
"The top 3 most satisfactory patterns were pattern D (x =4.00), pattern A (X =3.91), and pattern C (x =3.84)."
