This research presents the development of a stone lump detection machine for rubber cup lump.
The principle involves detecting stone lumps in rubber cup lump using near infrared spectroscopy with a wavelength range between 700 and 2500 nanometers and load cells.
This non-destructive technique allows for rapid and accurate detection to assist in separating rubber cup lump containing stone lumps and sand from the production line before causing damage to rubber pressing machines.
"In this study, the efficiency of detecting anomalies in rubber cup lump was investigated by conducting experiments with a model of rubber cup lump, consisting of 40 samples, each measuring 240 cubic centimeters and weighing 400 grams."
"The overall accuracy of anomaly detection averaged 82.5%, with an error rate of 17.5%."
The margin of error in detecting anomalies falls within the range between rubber cup lump samples without anomalies and those with anomalies at a rate of 10%.
