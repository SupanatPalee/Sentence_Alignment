This research presents a development of a solar-powered rain gauge system with wireless data transmission.
"In addition, the rainfall was recorded to an electrical signal."
It can be divided into four situations of rainfall such as 1) 0.1 - 10.0 mm.
"(small rainfall), 2) 10.1 - 35.0 mm."
"(medium rainfall), 3) 35.1 - 90.0 mm."
"(heavy rainfall), and    4) the rainfall is greater than or equal to 90.1 mm is defined as the highest heavy rainfall."
"In the experiments, the rainfall was recorded on June 21, 2019 at 7:00 am until June 22, 2019 at 7:00 am, total duration 24 hrs., in rainfall model."
"The results showed that the rainfall was greater than 90.1 mm., which indicated that the rainfall was highest heavy rainfall."
"Furthermore, the data of rainfall was sent in every 1 minute via NETIPE appellation on smart phone."
"Moreover, the rainfall was recorded in real situation on June 21, 2019 at 7:00 am until June 22, 2019 at 7:00 am, total duration 24 hrs."
"The obtained data from the rainfall is less than that 10.0 mm., which mean that the small rainfall."
"From the results, it can confirm that the proposed system can be used for measuring the rainfall."
