Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) are the basic requirements to help manufacturers produce quality products and meet the standards.
Farmer groups for this study are chosen by purposive sampling which encouraged them to produce premium grade thin brown crepe (TBC-P) from GAP cup lump.
"This research aimed to be standardized, analyze the cost-benefit and create added value."
"The results showed that cup lumps and crepe rubber were upgraded to be agricultural standards, and increase added value by 21.93 percent."
The cost-benefit analysis found that the investment of TBC-P had an NPV greater than zero and a BCR of more than 1 indicating that was worth the investment.
"More importantly, the government has adopted the GAP and GMP standard driving the local economies projects as a national strategy that can be created added value including sustainability for rubber farmers."
"To drive farmers' compliance with GAP and GMP should operate engagement in all sectors; farmers, government, and private sectors."
