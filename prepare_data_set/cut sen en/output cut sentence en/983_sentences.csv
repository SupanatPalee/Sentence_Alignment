"This research aimed to explore the effects of color and brightness in ceramic glaze and examine the physical qualifications of the best pottery glaze by adding titanium dioxide, and barium carbonate."
The two raw materials were purposively chosen from Triaxial diagram.
"The suitable number of experiments was 7 mixtures, and each mixture included 10%, 15%, and 20% of ferric oxide."
The characteristics of physical qualifications were studied after burning at 1230 degrees Celsius under an oxidation atmosphere.
"The results of this research showed that the glaze consisted of four-color tones which were  brown with spots, brown, dark brown , and  dark brown with small aventurine glaze."
"The values of the color glazing were at L* shade with the average at +2.19 to +30.56, a* shade with the average at -0.25 to +7.30, and at b* shade with the average at +4.76 to +18.79."
The physical qualifications of the glaze showed complete and glossy characteristics in every mixture.
"There were spots in 6 mixtures, and aventurine in 5 mixtures."
"The specular gloss meter was at 47 GU, and the physical qualifications of the glaze showed complete and glossy characteristic in every mixture."
"The developed glaze consisted of 45% of potash feldspar, 10% of dolomite, 13% of calcium carbonate, 7% of kaolin, and 25% of quartz."
"The additives used in the glaze were 1-10% of titanium dioxide, 1-10% of barium carbonate, and 10-20% of ferric oxide."
