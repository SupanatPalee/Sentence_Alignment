Collectors roads are the roads that distribute traffic flows from the arterial roads.
This kind of road plays an important role in the people journey within their community.
"Thus, characteristic and behavior of collector road users differ from the user of other types of road."
The Value of Time of the collector road can be calculated using the wage rate method.
"For that calculation, there are 9 parameters which are personal income, percentage of passenger cars, income factor, hourly wage, travel purpose, number of passengers in vehicle, Value of Time by each vehicle type, proportion of each vehicle type, and Passenger Car Equivalent Factor (PCE Factor)."
"From the analysis, 3 crucial parameters for VOT calculation were found, i.e., percentage of passenger cars, travel purpose, and personal income."
"After the data analysis, collector road users who travel by passenger car are the highest income person."
"The average monthly income of samples from RO.3044 and NK.3009 are 21,106.32 Baht and 24,119.05 Baht respectively."
"Most of the travelers, who use passenger car, are high income person, and their travel purpose is for business."
These three reasons affect the Value of Time.
"Thus, Values of Time for RO.3044 and NK.3009 are 232.33 Baht per PCU- hour and 217.72 Baht per PCU- hour respectively."
