This research was to design and construct of Utility Electrical Vehicle.
"These aims of design were safety chassis, light-weight body and driven by electrical engine."
Therefore this paper presents the design and construct of chassis made by tube space frame and the factor of safety (F.O.S) was 5.44 calculated by the commercial program in finite element.
The driven unit was selected to be 3hp DC-motor 60 volts and the electrical currency was supplied by 5 × 12 volt 60 Ah battery cell in series.
"The result shown that the performance of the vehicle: distance 40 km, top speed 38 km/h, loading weight 600 kg (10 persons), 30 degree of uphill slope and recharging time were 7 hours."
In addition this chassis modular can be modified for many applications in small – public transportation system all of government and private sectors.
