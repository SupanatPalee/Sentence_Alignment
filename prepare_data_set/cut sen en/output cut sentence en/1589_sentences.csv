The molecular genetic techniques for detection of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in “Nam Dok Mai” mango was studied.
The objective of this research was to develop analytical methods for C. Gloeosporioides of causing anthracnose in Nam Dok Mai mango by using Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) technique.
"In this research, the characteristics of C. gloeosporioides was analyzed by LAMP method."
The sensitivity and specificity of C. Gloeosporioides were also investigated.
"The study of the anthracnose disease symptoms in “Nam Dok Mai” mango which caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infection showed that slow colony growth on potato dextrose agar; PDA grayish white colony, Single cell conidia, oval and colorless and cylindrical spores."
"The determination of LAMP, It was found that the analyzed from the experiments 20 samples."
The study of the sensitivity of DNA detection was found at 50x10-4 µg/ml.
The detection of specificity for other bacteria was found that it did not show any cross-reactivity with other bacterial species.
The LAMP technique is a highly accurate DNA at the molecular biology and rapid test.
The analyzed most number of samples by using a few of DNA.
