The purpose of this research is to control shower cream filling of 6 nozzles filling machine according to TIS 1403-2008 and customer requirements.
"That is filling control, has a net volume of 500 milliliters under the weight between 516 - 518 grams."
The factory fills shower cream into the bottles and the weight of shower cream varies between 517.40 - 518.26 grams.
"Therefore, the researchers use cause and effect diagram to find the causes with the block experimental design, the results showed that there are no temperature control of shower cream before filling, unequal weight from volume control unit and different employees’ setting the weight."
Including the use of the relation diagram to find the key ideas to control via solving causes that may affect to variation.
"The research found that (1) the high temperature after mixing shower cream will cause to reduce the filling weight, (2) improving the resolution of volume control unit will control the stroke of the 6 nozzles piston rod differently and (3) establishing the procedure to adjust the volume of cylinder corresponding to the controlled temperature of shower cream will make the shower cream in each bottle having no significant difference in weight."
"After controlling 3 causes above, the weight of shower cream is in the range of 516.98 - 517.12 grams."
