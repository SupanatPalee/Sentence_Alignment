This research aims to design and develop baking oven with rotating tray and enhance dried food products for commerce.
The objective is to create stainless steel oven with also stainless steel trays according to the GMP standard.
The heating system is electric with digital temperature control unit.
The oven had hot-air circulation system with humidity expellant.
There are free-rotating trays driven by a transmission of an electric motor.
The baking performance when baking food ingredients reaches the standard of hot air baking activity and is 25% faster than normal baking oven.
The rate of electric power consumption is less than a dollar per hour (17.5 Baht).
This is 10.57% more economic than normal oven when the same amount of food ingredients is being baked.
The oven can handle mass-production activity and fulfill dried food industry of each community.
It can enhance capability in producing high quality local products that reach the standard for better community economy.
