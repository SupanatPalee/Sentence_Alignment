"High-heat transfer of jet impingement for cooling and heating processes becomes more important in engineering applications such as drying processes of paper and textiles, electronic components cooling, freezing of tissue, gas turbine blades cooling, refrigeration unit, and solar collectors, etc."
The comprehensive review of heat transfer intensification of jet impingement using non-swirling and swirling jets is reported in the present paper.
"In addition, heat transfer uniformity characteristics on surfaces of various swirling impinging jets are presented."
