"Currently, agricultural transportation using agricultural truck plays crucial role in Thailand."
"Statistically, a number of the agricultural trucks are continually increased."
This research therefore analyzes the strength and stiffness of agricultural truck chassis.
"The agricultural truck was selected by the a specific type of  sample group, which is agricultural truck used by U-Anan Karnchang, Chatturat District, Chaiyaphum Province."
The computer model of the chassis structure was created on the computer-aided engineering software.
The analysis was considered under the assumption of the static structural and linear elastic material properties by using flexible joint beam-type elements.
"There are four types of basic load behavior consisted of bending, torsion, longitudinal, and lateral loads considered."
The results of the study showed that the maximum stress was caused in the case of lateral load which was equal to 155.21 MPa.
The maximum deformation of the chassis in the case of bending load was equal to 5.65 mm.
"The results of bending and torsion stiffness showed that the values were 20,462.83 N./mm and 4,700.44 N.m/deg, respectively."
"Finally, the simplified case study was employed to validate the result."
"The torsion stiffness value when compare with the experimental result of case study structure has 8.3 and 0.6 percent error when analyzing with rigid joints and flexible joints, respectively."
The results of this research on all topics will be useful in increasing the safety of farmers' use.
