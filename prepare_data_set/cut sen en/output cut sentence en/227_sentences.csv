This research aims to develop a rubber speed bump product made of coconut coir dust as a filler and utilize the third grade of Rib Smoked Sheet (RSS 3) of 100 parts per hundred of rubber (phr).
"on coconut coir dust 0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 phr respectively."
"There were containing Zinc oxide, 5 phr."
"Stearic acid, 1 phr."
"Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 0.5 phr."
"Tetramethylurea disulfide (TMTD), 1.5 phr, Dimethyl butyl phenyl phenylenediamine (6PPD), 1.5 and Sulfur, 5 phr."
It was then compounded by two rollers with stock blender rubber and forming by hot compression method at 150 Â°C for 40 minutes.
"According to the rubber speed bump of Thai Industry Standard (TIS 2726-2559), the properties were tested."
The result revealed that the rubber speed bump made of coconut coir dust as a filler in the ratio of 80 phr had suitable properties for developing the rubber speed bump according to the rubber speed bump of Thai Industry Standard (TIS 2726-2559).
