Induction machines have widely been used in many industrial factories.
"In the case of emergency, braking torque is always needed."
One of the simple braking methods is dc current injection.
"In order to stop the machines in efficient manner with a desired operating time, their accurate speed-torque curves in the braking zone are often required."
It has been reported in the open literature that machine’s braking torque curve calculations have not yet been fully completed so far due to an ignorance of their nonlinear effects.
"Thus, this paper presents an extension to the braking torque-speed curve calculation of induction machines under dc injection braking."
The saturation of mutual and rotor-leakage reactances as well as the slip-dependent rotor resistance are entirely taken into account.
"To validate the proposed model, the braking torque-speed curves between calculation and laboratory measurement are compared."
A good agreement is observed in the satisfactory manner.
"Moreover, an application of the proposed torque-speed curve in determining the machine’s braking time is demonstrated."
An acceptable accuracy in the breaking times between calculation and measurement approaches is shown.
The popularity of raising native chicken breeds in Thailand is increasing.
The use of egg incubators helps reduce problems arising from natural egg hatching and shortens the incubation period for hens.
This contributes to increased overall productivity.
"However, there is no information available on whether the egg incubators available in the market are specifically designed to meet the needs of the target users in this research."
"To design egg incubators considering the needs of the users, this study proposes an approach utilizing Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to transform quality-related functions into engineering planning."
"Additionally, the House of Quality (HOQ) is used to link quality characteristic data and technical requirements."
"The analysis results indicate that the design direction of the egg incubator should strongly emphasize technical requirements related to usability, including: 1."
"Design for ease of use and easy operation control, incorporating bright lights to facilitate machine observation during operation."
2.
"Implement a safety system to enhance machine safety during use, including status lights to indicate abnormal operations and the ability to cut power in case of malfunctions."
3.
"Incorporate an automatic control system covering temperature, humidity, and egg turning."
"Comparing the performance with competitors, the proposed egg incubator design differs from those available in the market by incorporating an automated water refilling system, resulting in enhanced automation during operation."
