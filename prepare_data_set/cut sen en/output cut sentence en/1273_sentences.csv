"In present, most pagodas are constructed using reinforced concrete."
"However, studies on the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete pagodas remain limited."
Most study reports on the dynamics behavior of pagodas are of masonry pagodas and timber pagodas which have been constructed since ancient times.
This research aims to study the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete pagodas using a direct measurement method and the use of a finite element model.
The studied pagoda is the Ban Koh temple pagoda located in Udon Thani province.
The pagoda is Lanka bell shape with height of about 72 meters.
"The structure of the pagoda is a system of reinforced concrete columns, beams, slabs and walls."
"As a result from the direct measurement under ambient vibration using accelerometers, the dynamic properties of the pagoda including the first mode natural vibration frequency, natural vibration mode shape of the first mode and damping ratio were obtained and used for calibration of model parameter of the finite element model."
The finite element model was then adopted for further study on the dynamic behavior of the pagoda.
"From the study results, a better understanding on the dynamic behavior of the reinforced concrete pagoda was obtained and a guideline for modeling of the reinforced concrete pagoda was suggested."
