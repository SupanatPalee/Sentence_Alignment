"Filter cake is a waste product which has a calorific value comparable to bagasse and can be used as a general fuel and can be extruded in biomass power plants, in the sugar production phase of the sugar factory."
"The objective of this research was to investigate the physical properties of filter cake, specifically moisture content, bulk density, angle of repose, and coefficient of friction."
This includes investigating the formation of pellets from filter cake using a roller molding test set on a flat die.
"The analysis was carried out using a standardized moisture content of 30.26 percent wet basis together with the test factor including three ranges of feed rates: 40, 45, and 50 kg/h, as well as four levels of compression die speeds: 180, 190, 200, and 210 rpm."
"According to the study results, the filter cake with a wet basis moisture content at 30.26 percent, shaped at a feed rate of 45 kg/h, and the compression die at 210 rpm, is the most appropriate."
"Being in harmony with the standard range that the suitable pellets should have the following dimensions: average diameter 5.66±0.04 mm, average length 31.53±0.37 mm, average fines 1.31±0.01, average durability 98.26±0.05 percent, and average bulk density 691.32±5.00 kg / m3."
"It has an estimated calorific value of 11,928 J / g, specially designed for use as a supplemental fuel in the biomass electric power generation."
