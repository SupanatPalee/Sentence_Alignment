"In Chiang Dao Municipality slaughterhouse, the electric heater was used to produce hot water of 2,500 liters at 65 ℃ for the scalding and scraping of pigs processes which wasted a lot of electricity."
"Therefore, this research aims to use solar photovoltaic thermal hybrid assisted heat pump to reduce electricity consumption."
The mathematical model was developed for the optimum choosing of type and size of Solar PV/T both mono-Si PV/T and poly-Si PV/T based on economic analysis.
The study divided into two parts.
The first part was a test to establish the mathematical equations to predict the performance of solar PV/T panels and heat pump performance.
"From the study, it was found that the mono-Si PV/T panels obtained FR(τα)e and FRUL with 0.328 and 7.2997 W/m2×K respectively, while FR(τα)e and FRUL of poly-Si PV/T panels were 0.275 and 8.4743 W/m2·K, respectively, and the average energy efficiency ratio (EER) of the heat pump was equal to2.38 Wth/We."
"In the second part of the study, the mathematical models were used to predict the optimized system."
It was found that the mono-Si PV/T of 295 WP 16 panels combined with the 17.8 kWth heat pump was the most suitable for producing hot water in Chiang Dao Municipality slaughterhouses.
"The electrical energy from the gridline could be decreased by 31,465.06 kWh/year or equivalent to a cost of electricity that compared to the electric heater use about 142,536.72 Baht/year."
"The system required an investment cost was 888,314.00 Baht and the payback period were equal to 6.23 years."
The successful design and development process of the product is a challenge for organizations.
"In the case study company, a small industrial business that designs and manufactures interior and exterior plastic parts for automobiles, initiated a project to develop a new pattern of car window visor in order to transform from an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) to an OBM (Original Brand Manufacturer) or to produce under its own style and brand."
The case study company successfully implemented the project and was able to quickly introduce innovative new products to the market before new competitors emerged.
This research aims to study the various factors used in developing a new pattern of car window visor (car awning trim) and analyze the factors affecting the success of the project.
The researcher studied the development process of the new pattern of car window visor (car awning trim) of this case study company.
The resource data and related details were collected using secondary data obtained from two previous research articles under the project of developing a new car window visor product of the case study company.
The researcher also analyzed the data on various factors that are used in this project.
"To summarize the factors affecting the success of the project, it was found that the key success factors have 5 elements called ‘SEPIC’, which come from Speed of each process, Equipment support, Person involved, Innovation, and Capital strength."
