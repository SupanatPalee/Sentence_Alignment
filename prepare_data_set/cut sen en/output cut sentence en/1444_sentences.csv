Coffee is a popular drink in many countries.
"The more consumption of coffee drinks, the more environmental impacts generated by their production and consimption."
"Other than pastic waste problem, the life cycle of coffee drinks also brings about greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming."
"To provide the recommendations on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of coffee drinks, this study aimed at assessing and comparing the carbon footprint of coffee beverages, including mocha, cappuccino, latte, and espresso."
"Life cycle of the coffee beverages, covering raw material production, packaging, coffee making, and the disposal of baverage container were considered in this study."
"The results showed that the carbon footprint of a glass of mocha, cappuccino, latte, and espresso (in which 18 g ground coffee were equally used) were around 625, 506, 541 and 160 g CO2 equivalent, respectively."
Raw materials with the highest greenhouse gas emissions were cow's milk and chocolate.
This lead to the largest carbon footprint of mocha in which both cow’s milk and chocolate were used as the ingredients.
"Not only does the results of this study have an implication on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from coffee drinks, but also the method presented in this study can be a guideline for for other beverages’ carbon footprinting."
