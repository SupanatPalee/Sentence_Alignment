"This research studied the behaviors of adsorption of lead on three kinds of biomass ash i.e., fly ash, wooden ash and bagasse ash."
"The effects of contact time, the adsorption capability and the adsorption isotherm were investigated by the batch method."
The concentrations of the solution used in the batch test were in the range of 1-1000 mg/L.
The results indicated that the adsorption reached to equilibrium within 30 minutes that the most rapid adsorption occurred in the bagasse ash.
The adsorption capability decreased when the initial concentration increased.
Freundlich model could describe the adsorption of all ash better than Langmuir model.
"The adsorption capacities in ascending order was bagasse ash, wood ash and fly ash."
The specific area of the ashes affected the adsorption capacities.
