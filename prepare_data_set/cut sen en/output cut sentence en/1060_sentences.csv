The objective of this research was to study the optimum conditions of the combined microwave with hot-air drying on drying of turmeric.
"The prototype designed to use 1,000 watts magnetron and 800 watts heater."
"This research was dried with three different drying methods: microwave, hot-air and microwave combined with hot-air that using turmeric weighing 100 grams."
"The microwave drying was carried out in a microwave oven with output power of 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 540 W, while the hot-air drying was carried out at drying air temperatures of 60, 70 and 80 ๐C."
"The drying time to test is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes with air velocity of 0.5 ."
"The results showed that the optimum point of the microwave with hot-air for drying is the microwave power of 800 watts and hot air temperature of 60 ๐C, which takes 10 minutes."
"In addition, using microwave with hot air for drying can maintain the color quality of turmeric after drying better than just drying and drying with hot-air."
"The microwave with the hot air has cost of 15,000 baht."
The break-even point of the machine is 134.27 and the payback period is 2 months.
It can be concluded that the method of microwave drying combined with hot-air can reduce the drying time and preserve the quality of turmeric after drying.
