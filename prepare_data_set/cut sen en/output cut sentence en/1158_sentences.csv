This research is to develop of the split water machine for bean sprout washing by air blower on belt conveyor.
This split water machine is made from the steels.
Belt system is made from the PVC mesh holes that the belt structure is made from stainless steel with attached to the chain.
"The belt has a width of 1.0 m, a long of 6.0 m and a height of 1.2 m. It is driving by electric motor and is installing the blowers system on the cover of belt."
"The experimental that the speed of belt was set to 6 levels of 3.68, 7.50, 10.90, 15.65, 18.95, and 24.00 m/min."
"The wind speed of the air blowers was set to 6 levels of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 m/s."
The results showed that the efficiency of the machine was 90% at the belt speed of 3.68 m/min and the wind speed of 10 m/s.
The speed of belt was low and the wind speed was high that will increase the efficiency of the split water machine.
The performance of the machine is 736 kg/hr at the highest efficiency of the machine.
"When, calculating the payback period for the split water machine for bean sprout washing by air blower on belt conveyor for substitute labors and old spinning machine was 3.3 months that can reduce the labor cost and reduce the cost of sprout cultivation for sale to entrepreneurs in the future."
It can be used as a prototype for drying agricultural crops that need to be washed as well.
