The objectives of this research are to analyze the distribution of household land holdings and analyze the relationship between the size of agricultural area and number of household members.
The research process began with updating spatial database of the household land tenure boundary by field survey and inquiring about land use and number of household members.
The data analysis method was performed using the Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient to measure the inequality of land ownership.
The Correlation Coefficient and Coefficient of Determination were used to measure the direction of relationship and the amount of relationship between the area of agricultural holding and the number of household member.
"The result of research showed that the Lorenz Curve of land holding is far from the line of equal distribution, it means that the land holdings are inequality with the inequality coefficient of Gini Coefficient was 0.31."
The size of the area held by household was correlated with the number of household members with a Correlation Coefficient (r ) of 0.34.
The size of agricultural area held by households was result of 11 percent of the household members with a Coefficient of Determination (r2 ) of 0.11.
It was concluded that the land held was not due to the number of household members.
