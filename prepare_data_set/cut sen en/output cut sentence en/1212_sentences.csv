This study aims to 1) Identify problems and barriers impeding facility management 2) Propose guidelines for sustainable facility management.
Data were collected through in-depth interview with six staff responsible for facility management in Kasetsart University at various levels together with records from selected buildings which have been operating for more than 10 years.
"The interview consists of 4 parts including Strategic Planning, Facility & Real Estate Portfolio Management, Project Management and Operation & Maintenance Management."
Actual on-site observation was done by walking through with the facility managers of 5 selected buildings.
"Archival records such as Kasetsart University’s strategic plan and action plans, as well as annual capital budgets were also used as secondary data."
The analysis reveals the two areas that the university lacks.
First issue is Facility & Real Estate Port Folio Management where there is no utility space evaluation and also no categorization and prioritization of project approval.
"The second issue is Operations & Maintenance Management where there is no standardized process for space planning, no cost/benefit assessment of extra space requirement, as well as central database of availability and utility of building space that can give the whole picture of university’s building space."
