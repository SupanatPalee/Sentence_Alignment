The purpose of this research A Study Capacity and Comparison of sugarcane loading into the truck between labor and elevator cooperated with labor.
"Determine the test factors for the speed of the conveyor chain in 3 levels, namely 10, 12 and 14 rpm."
The test results showed that Conveyor chain speed at 12 rpm.
"have the ability to work in real life as much as possible However, when increasing the speed of the conveyor chain at 14 rpm."
the laborers on the truck were unable to arrange the cane bundles in time.
Workers who feed the sugar cane below must slow down the capacity of the conveying system.
The average actual working capacity is 6.40 tons/hr.
which is 4 tons/hr.
higher than manual labor who can load sugar cane into trucks.
It was found that the cost of using the sugarcane loading machine together with human labor was lower than using manual labor alone.
The break-even point and payback period are 242.64 tons and 28 operating days when using the speed of the conveyor chain 12 rpm.
