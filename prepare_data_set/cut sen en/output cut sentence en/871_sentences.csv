This research presents an online web based instructional management through the Google Sites program.
Online teaching can solve teaching problems in the subject of equipment and electronic circuits during the epidemic situation of the corona virus 2019.
"Research tools include: online lessons, worksheets, instructional materials, and quizzes."
"The research process begins with the study of relevant research, analyze course content on electronic devices and circuits, and design online lessons through the Google Sites program."
"Online teaching experiments were used with a sample group of 22 first-year vocational students in the Mechatronics Engineering program, enrolled in the second semester of the academic year 2021, totaling 22 people, Chiang Mai Technical College."
Then collect research data and draw conclusions according to the research hypothesis.
"The research statistics consisted of the Meguigans theory standardized performance test, independent t-test, mean of 5 rating scale value, and standard deviation."
"The results showed that 1) the quality of the developed online instruction evaluated by 5 experts was appropriate at a high level (mean was 4.07 and standard deviation was 0.38), 2) the efficiency of developed online instruction agreed to Meguigans' performance standard that equaled to 1.20, 3) the comparison of learning achievement after learning was higher than before learning at the .05 level of significance, and 4) learners were satisfied with online learning management at a high level (mean equal to 4.07 and standard deviation equal to 0.38), which results are in line with the research hypothesis setting."
The research results can be used as a guideline for self-learning teaching and learning and applied to lifelong learning to support learning in the 21st century.
