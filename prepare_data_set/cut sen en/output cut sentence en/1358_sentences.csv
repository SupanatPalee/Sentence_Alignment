This research presents a method for classifying Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
"The CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset of MRI images, which allows the model to learn patterns and specific features of MRI images related to various diseases or medical conditions."
Simulation result show that the appropriate model for classification of Alzheimer’s brain MRI image is ResNet50.
This is used the less epochs for training compared to MobileNetV2 and efficientNetB7 with high accuracy.
