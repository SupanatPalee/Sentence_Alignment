COVID-19 has spread quickly throughout the world.
The public health system has been significantly impacted by this pandamic.
"For people infected with COVID-19 who have comorbidity, this increases the severity of symptoms and increases the risk of mortality."
The objective of this research was to characterize the COVID-19 patient and find the influence factors for the mortality of COVID-19 patients.
The study population included COVID-19 cases collected between 14 February and 31 April 2020.
"Real-time data were collected from open-source COVID-19 repositories which collected data on 481,289 COVID-19 cases from 141 countries with a sample size of 1,143 people with complete data."
The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression were used for identifying the factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 and constructed ROC curves to determine the appropriate cut-off point to predict the chance of mortality in patients with COVID-19.
"The results found that five factors: Gender (OR=2.262 ; 95%CI= 1.519-3.367), Age (OR= 1.118 ; 95%CI= 1.102 - 1.134), Malignancy (OR= 0.193 ; 95%CI=0.039 - 0.949), Pneumonia (OR= 7.173 ; 95%CI= 2.818 - 18.254), and ARDS (OR=11.488 ; 95%CI=4.105 - 32.148) influenced the mortality of COVID-19 patients with percentage of correct predictions of 86%."
"Moreover, the sensitivity by ROC curve also showed very high accuracy."
