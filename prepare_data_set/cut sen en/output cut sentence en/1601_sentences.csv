Propolis is one kind of natural substance produced by honeybees and exerts various pharmacological activities.
"The aim of this research was to determine total phenolic, flavonoid contents, antioxidant activity, and chemical compositions of propolis extracts."
Propolis from Nan province was extracted by 70%v/v ethanol and water solvents.
"The extracts were determined for their total phenolic, flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity by using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay, aluminium chloride colorimetric assay, and DPPH radical scavenging assay, respectively."
The chemical compositions of propolis extracts were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD).
The results showed total phenolic and flavonoid contents of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) were higher significantly than the water extract of propolis (WEP) (p<0.05).
"The total phenolic contents of EEP and WEP were 2.890±0.018 and 1.849±0.017 mg equivalent gallic acid per g of propolis, respectively."
"The flavonoid contents of EEP and WEP were 0.616±0.005 and 0.531±0.007 mg equivalent quercetin per g of propolis, respectively."
"Moreover, EEP had the higher efficiency to scavenge DPPH free radical than WEP, the IC50 values of EEP and WEP were 78.85 and 246.51 µg/ml, respectively."
"Analysis of propolis extracts by HPLC-DAD revealed the unidentical major compound at 7.1 minute retention time, which may have important biological activity."
"This study suggested that propolis extract, especially EEP is a source of antioxidant which might have the potential to use in drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics."
