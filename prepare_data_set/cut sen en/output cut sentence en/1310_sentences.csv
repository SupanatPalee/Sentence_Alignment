This article aims to produce the dissimilar metals butt joint between AISI1015 carbon steel and AISI304 stainless steel using a shielded metal arc welding.
"Welding process parameter in this study was a welding current of 80-120 A and a welding electrode of E307, E309 and E312."
The summarized results are as follows.
The butt joint of AISI1015 carbon steel and AISI304 stainless steel could be successfully produced using SMAW process.
Optimized welding parameter that suggested highest impact strength was the welding current of 100 à¸¤ and the welding electrode of E312.
Micro-hardness examination results showed the highest hardness at the weld metal because of the formation of the dendrite structure and carbide phase in the fusion area.
Absorbed energy of the joint was higher when the joint was welded by the electrode that contained higher chromium and carbon.
"Dendrite structure in the weld metal that large, short and uniform, affected directly to increase the joint impact strength."
