"This paper presents the non-ideal of ECG signal measurement which is caused from the common mode noise,  half-cell potential and tissue resistance."
The problems are introduced that arise from measuring the small biological signals using the electrode probes.
It is described in the form of a tissue-electrode interface of equivalent circuit model with the front-end amplifier circuit.
"For the simulation using the various parameters compared with the distortion of the signal, the results found that the measured voltage of common mode noise is in the range of ±250 mV."
The half-cell potential is in the range of ±150 mV and tissue resistance values does not exceed the input impedance of the front-end amplifier also make the circuit distortion less than 1%.
