The objective of this research was to improve the efficiency of tire flap manufacturing process.
"This research is to apply ""Lean Manufacturing"" concept and related techniques to eliminate waste, used to analyze the production wastes, used to construct current stage value stream mapping."
This method helps to visualize the Problem and waste activities.
"In order to reduce production waste, Process flow chart, Process Activity Mapping, Value–Added Activities, Non-Value-Added Activities, Non–Value-Added but Necessary Activities and 7 Wastes."
And then used the ECRS method for wastes reduction with 5W1H were applied.
"From the study result, the highest flap curing process waste time and Non–Value-Added."
"From the result after applied new method we founded that the work element reduced 31 element, 26 percent and Cycle Time reduced from 1,050.87 sec, 26 percent and the production efficiency has improved 26 percent."
Increasing productivity is key to fulfilling customer requirements and remaining competitive in today's fast-paced business world.
The purpose of this research was to increase the productivity of sprinkler parts.
"Through the analysis of motion and time, it was discovered that the leaf stamping process and the leaf and stalk arc stages exceeded the Takt time."
"To address this issue, left-right hand charts and jig design were used to minimize work waste."
"The research yielded a reduction in the processing time of the leaf stamping process from 7.07 seconds to 3.02 seconds, a reduction of 57.25 percent, and the stem and leaf arc process time was reduced from 7.77 seconds to 2.97 seconds, a reduction of 61.78 percent, respectively."
These improvements helped the company in the case study to produce according to customer demand and reduce its inventory levels.
