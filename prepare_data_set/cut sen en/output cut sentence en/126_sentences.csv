This research aimed to study a suitable condition for producing bamboo sheets from bamboo scraps.
The size of bamboo scraps was 3 centimeters and the moisture content did not exceed 13%.
The solder is made from natural materials.
"There were 3 levels of temperature for a hot compress, i.e."
"170, 190 and 210 degrees Celsius and there were 3 levels of extrusion time, namely, 10, 15 and 20 minutes."
"Physical and mechanical properties were tested, which include thickness swelling, bending test, bond strength of bolts, and tensile test, to compare to Thai industrial standard for flat pressed (FP) particleboard TIS."
876-2547).
"The study results revealed that the suitable condition for bamboo sheet hot extrusion from bamboo scraps was at the hot compress temperature of 190 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes, due to its highest average bending, highest average modulus of bending, highest average bending strain, highest average tensile strength and modulus of tensile."
The comparison result to Thai industrial standard (TIS.
"876-2547) found they passed 3 standards of average thickness swelling, tensile strength and modulus of tensile and did not pass 2 standards of bending and modulus of bending."
"In addition, the satisfaction test score of bamboo sheet hot extrusion from bamboo scraps was 3.41, at a high level."
