Continuously operating reference station is a station established for the immediate reception and transmission of satellite data to the control stations as part of the network RTK in Thailand for Cadastral Surveying created by the Department of Lands.
"In this research, the satellite signal data from the continuously operating reference station is compiled as a reference station for checking the wall movement of Pha Daeng mine in Tak province by using rapid static survey."
There are three steps to testing.
The first step is testing for a suitable continuously operating reference station for the Pha Daeng mine area.
It was found that Mae Sot Station in Tak Province was the most suitable.
The second step is testing the accuracy of the coordinates by using the coordinates obtained from the GNSS survey to compare them with the coordinates obtained from the total station.
"It was found that the accuracy of the average horizontal and vertical coordinates was ±0.020 meters and ±0.040 meters, respectively."
The third step is testing for the displacement of the walls of Pha Daeng mine by specifying 12 test points covering the area prone to displacement.
"It was found that the walls of Pha Daeng mine had less movement, with the horizontal rating of no more than 0.002 meters and the vertical rating of no more than 0.003 meters."
