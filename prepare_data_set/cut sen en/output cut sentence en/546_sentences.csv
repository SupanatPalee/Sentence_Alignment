The objective of this paper is to analyze the factors that affect the dimension of low water absorption of new product; wall tile porcelain without edge trimming.
Design of experiment with full factorial analysis is employed including multiple regression analysis for model fitting.
The experimental results reveal that pressing pressure and powder shrinkage affect the dimension of such tile porcelain while other quality requirements of water absorption and modulus of rupture are compliant with the standards.
"The appropriate value setting for both factors are recommended at 362 kg/cm2 and 7.56 percent, respectively."
"In addition, the research’s results can be applied in determining standard manufacturing procedures of other new products and improving productivity of pressing machine in terms of set up time reduction."
