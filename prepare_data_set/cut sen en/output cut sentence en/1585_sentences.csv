The objective of this research was to study the effect of pellet fertilizer from waste hythane production process from residues of sewage and yeast plus organic materials on rice growth and yield.
"The experiment design was a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) of 11 treatments with 3 replications number per treatment: treatment 1 unfertilized (control), treatment 2 chemical fertilizer formula 15-15-15, treatment 3-11 fertilizer pellets formula 1-9 were applied respectively at Plant Science Field, Faculty of Food and Agricultural Technology, Pibulsongkram Rajabhat University."
"The result showed that the chemical fertilizer provided the highest growth and yield of rice in terms of plant height of 113.87 cm, 23.33 plants per clump, and fresh weight of seeds of 799.15 kg/rai."
The second highest growth and yield of rice was treatment 9 (fertilizer pellets formula 7).
While the lowest growth and yield of rice was the controlled treatment.
The properties of fertilizer pellets produced was qualified to meet the requirement of the Standards for Organic Fertilizer B.E.2557 (2014).
