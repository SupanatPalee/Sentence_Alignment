This paper presents the stabilization for 3 phase AC-DC converter feeding controlled buck converter.
Power converters with their controllers normally behave as constant power loads that can affect system stability.
"Therefore, the Reference-Voltage-Based active compensator (RVC) method will be presented to mitigate the instability due to the constant power load."
The results will show that the proposed system can become back from unstable to stable operation when the RVC is applied.
The simulation via the exact topological model of MATLAB is used to validate the theoretical results in which the good agreement between the theory and the simulation is achieved.
