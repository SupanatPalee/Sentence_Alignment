The goal of this research was to study the circulation of the horizontal steam circulating system.
The behavior of the system relies on pressure to drive the flow of the working fluid.
The conditions to be studied are length of steam circulation.
"An operation of the circulation of the horizontal steam circulating system consisted of four stages: heating, pumping, cooling, and circulating."
"From the test, it is found that the mass flow rate of the steam affects the cycle time."
"When the flow rate is high, the system takes less turnover time and the amount of thermal energy stored was reduced accordingly."
"For a 16 m circulating length, the max thermal efficiency was 87.46, with the distance increased from 16 m to 18 m the efficiency decreased by 13.72% and the distance increased from 18 m to 20 m the efficiency decreased by 18.42%."
"Therefore, to increase the distance of steam circulation, it is necessary to increase the pressure in the system as well."
