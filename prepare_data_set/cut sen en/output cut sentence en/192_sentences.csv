A new basic design and analysis for two-fluid mixture process simulation were developed using moving particle simulation (MPS).
The interaction between two-fluid was modeled by the finite volume method (FVM).
The numerical simulation in this research using the Finite Element Method (FEM) together with a multi-time-step algorithm was introduced into the MES method to calculate the effects of interaction and contact between two-fluid bodies and between blade rotor bodies and walls.
The results of the analysis showed that at 100 rpm of the agitator rotation in the vertical and the horizontal axis.
"Ready to be installed a stator into the blade of the agitator set on both axes, the best mixing rate of the fluid was achieved compared to other models."
The proposed MES method using the optimized FEA and FVM model was then applied to a mixture process.
The concept of the proposed approach is expansively applicable to 3D mixture process form design or other consumer product forms.
The effect of impeller-blade angle and revolutions per minute on performance of mixture process was investigated using commercial software.
