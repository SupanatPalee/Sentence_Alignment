This paper aims to study effects of interground fly ash cement and fly ash on chloride resistance of concrete after exposure to marine environment of Thailand for seven years.
"Portland cement type I, Portland cement type V, interground fly ash cement and partial replacement of cement by fly ash were used for binder in concrete."
"Water to binder (w/b) ratios of 0.20, 0.40 and 0.60 and fly ash to binder ratios of 0.20, 0.40 and 0.60 were used."
"From the experimental results, concretes with interground fly ash cement and with fly ash replacement had higher chloride penetration resistance than concretes with Portland cement types I and V. Concrete with Portland cement type I had higher chloride penetration resistance than concrete with Portland cement type V. Furthermore, it was found that chloride penetration resistance of concrete mixed with interground fly ash cement was close to that with binder replacement by fly ash at 40%."
"Finally, concrete containing binder replacement by fly ash at 60% with w/b of 0.40 had the highest chloride resistance."
