This research has brought the Internet of Things technology to support automatic machine development.
"It aims to design and develop a mini CNC milling machine-controlling system with high-precision suitable for wood, acrylic sheet and small workpieces, and easy to move when compared with a large machine."
"This research was carried out by using ADDIE Model, including analysis, design, development, implementation, and outcome evaluation of small CNC milling machines."
"The CNC milling machine operation can be controlled via a web browser developed by Node-RED software and the instruction dataset is transmitted by MQTT Protocol, a core standard protocol of ISO/IEC 20922:2016."
The results showed that the movement of the mini CNC milling machine can be controlled precisely.
"The variation in the X-axis is 1.00, the Y-axis is 1.00, and the Z-axis is 0.99, and it also reduces the problem of installing the driver package on the operating system."
