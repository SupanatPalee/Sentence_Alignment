Construction drawings and specifications that are inconsistent with the work on the construction site.
"The above problems affect the success of the building construction projects in terms of time, cost and quality of work."
The purpose of this research is to study problems of construction drawings and specifications in construction projects.
Various problems arising in each project and interviews with people involved in the construction project were gathered to create a questionnaire.
The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
"The hypotheses, opinions of business groups and working experience were tested on the problems of the construction drawings and the specifications of construction projects."
"The results of the study found that the significance index (SI) of the most problematic issues focused on the following issues: 1) Problems arising from the accompanying list of unclear scope of work, 2) Problems arising from the structure plan, indicating the position and distance of the opening, conflict with the architectural design and the building system assembly, 3) Problems arising from unspecified or incomplete architectural drawings."
"In addition, the hypothesis testing found that the business group and work experience had different opinions on several problems."
"Finally, this research recommends the preparation of a checklist for the correctness and completeness of the construction drawings and the specifications to support the construction project's goals."
