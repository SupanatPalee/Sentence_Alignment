"In this paper, the use of electrostatic principle for removal of equivalent particle size of viruses for personal protective equipment applications was theoretical and experimental studied."
"The electrostatic collector used in this study was designed, constructed, and evaluated."
An analytical model was developed to investigate particle transport inside the electrostatic collector.
"In this study, experimental investigations were carried out for neutralized particles of 100 nm in diameter that is an equivalent particle size of viruses, the positively applied voltage at the inner electrode ranged from 1 to 5 kV and aerosol flow rates ranged between 0.6 and 1.5 L/min."
The calculation results showed that all neutralized particles of 100 nm in diameter could precipitate on the outer electrode of the electrostatic collector at applied voltage of about 5 kV and aerosol flow rate of about 0.6 L/min.
"For all aerosol flow rates, an increase in applied voltage produced an increase in particle collection efficiency of the collector."
Experiments confirmed that the efficiency of the electrostatic collector could increase over 90% at an applied voltage of about 5 kV for all aerosol flow rates.
The developed electrostatic collector proved to be particularly useful in removing equivalent particle size of viruses for personal protective equipment applications.
