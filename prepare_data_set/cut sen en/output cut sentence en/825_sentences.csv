The objective of this research is to reduce the weight loss of pineapple pie filling that weighs less than 130 kilograms specified in each production process.
The weight loss of this pineapple pie filling is caused by improper adjustment of the parameters of the machine used in production.
"From the analysis of the cause using the fishbone diagram, it was found that the factors that affect the weight loss of the pineapple pie filling are the temperature and the time for stirring the pie filling."
"Therefore, in order to find the suitable stirring pie parameters by using the general full factorial method."
"The results showed that the temperature and time used for stirring pineapple pie are 215 degrees Celsius and 43 minutes respectively, which can be reduced the weight loss of 0.8 kilograms per time of production."
"Decreased the value of loss 230,400 bah /year."
