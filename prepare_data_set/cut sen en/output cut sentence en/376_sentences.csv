This research aims to determine the optimal ratio of palm oil sludge to water hyacinth for producing environmentally friendly seedling pots and to investigate the chemical and physical properties and effectiveness of pots made from the mixture on seedling cultivation.
"This experiment was arranged in completely randomized design (CRD) with six treatments and five replications based on different mixture ratios of palm oil sludge (POS) and water hyacinth (WH) at the ratio of 5 : 0 (T1), 4 : 1 (T2), 3 : 2 (T3), 2 : 3 (T4), 1 : 4 (T5) and 0 : 5 (T6) respectively."
"T2, T3, and T4 could be completely molding into pots."
"POS and WH had pH values of 6.81±0.04 and 6.48±0.17, electrical conductivity (EC) values of 3.36±0.22 and 0.06±0.04 dS/m."
"Percentage of total N, P2O5 and K2O in POS were 1.84, 3.89 and 2.69 respectively, and in WH were 1.88, 0.28 and 4.10 respectively."
T3 showed the highest water absorption capacity (56.52±4.15%) and T2 had the highest inflating capacity (28.79±3.65%).
"At 2 and 3 weeks after seedling of Brassica rapa L. in pots from treatment 2, 3, and 4 was statistical difference in plant height (P<0.05)."
"T3 resulting in the highest plant height of 3.96±0.49 and 5.12±0.46 cm, respectively."
The evaluation results found that all treatment did not deterioration in the physical characteristics of the pots during seedling cultivation.
"Therefore, this research is an alternative way to use waste materials as an alternative to plastic seedling pots, which have a slow decomposition rate, thus providing an environmentally friendly solution."
