"Most of the agriculture area in Thailand lacks water resources, causing farmers to drill groundwater to use as a source of water for cultivation."
"In addition, most of the agricultural areas are inaccessible to electrical transmission lines."
"For this reason, the application of solar water pump is widely interested."
"However, the performance of the solar pump is still an importance information that must be considered for designing the system of solar water pump."
"Therefore, submersible solar water pump, DC motor of 300 W, was constructed for testing its performance."
Photovoltaic panel of 340 Wp was selected as electrical energy source.
"Pressure drop of solar water pump studied in this work were 10, 15 and 20 m. The experiments were conducted under real conditions of solar irradiance varied ranging 400-1,000 W/m2."
"The criteria for evaluating the performance of solar water pump system were photovoltaic panel efficiency, electrical power ratio, efficiency of solar water pump and efficiency of solar water pump system."
"It was found from experimental results that photovoltaic panel efficiency and electrical power ratio are 15% and 0.64, respectively."
"Additionally, it was also revealed that solar water pump and system of solar water pump provide the efficiency in the range of 22.0-27.0% and 3.3-4.0%, respectively."
