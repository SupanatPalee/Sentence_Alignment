The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of Thai Pathumthani Fragrant Rice on high temperature in recirculation batch drying.
"Dimension of drying is 2270 mm in height, 2481 mm in width and 1070 mm in length."
It has a capacity of 1.5 tons.
Research and development of automatic drying for Thai Pathumthani Fragrant Rice in the form of recirculation batch drying.
"The properties of the dehumidification temperature were tested and the tested in provided were temperature, time and heat source type."
Even though the drying process test results.
"Each experiment demonstrated that the 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline (2AP) evaporation at the drying temperature was 60 ° C, when the temperature increase would reduce the moisture content of rice."
"Therefore, before drying of Thai Pathumthani Fragrant Rice, the value of 2AP»1.465 micrograms per gram was analyzed, and after recirculation drying, it was 2AP»1.580 micrograms per gram."
