This paper focused on improvement of carbon cold premixed asphalt with natural rubber.
"Carbon cold premixed asphalt specimens were improved with natural rubber 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 percent by weight, respectively with curing age of 1, 3, 7, 10 days, respectively."
These were conducted by Marshall's test to determine the stability and flow of each sample.
"From test results, the stability of carbon cold premixed asphalt specimens improved with natural rubber 4 percent by weight at curing age of 7 and 10 days as 1821.17 and 1932.82 lb, respectively, which were higher than that of hot mixed asphalt (1800 lb)."
It was due to natural rubber increasing cohesion resistant and durability.
"Thus, carbon cold premixed asphalt improved with natural rubber can be applied instead of hot mixed asphalt."
