This research aims to produce the hygienic masks for bacterial inhibition in respiratory system by adding menthol and tannin extracts from peppermint and cassava leaves respectively.
It was found that the appropriate conditions for menthol extraction were the peppermint leaves at 45 g was extracted with steam for 30 min and that of tannin extracts were the ratio of cassava leaves to 95% ethanol at 1 g : 20 ml.
was extracted for 4 hr at room temperature.
The menthol and tannin extracts were characterized by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).
It was found that both extracts were menthol and tannin as the standard.
The results of bacterial inhibition properties showed that 15 mg/mL of menthol and 5 mg/mL of tannin extracts exhibited the highest inhibition of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Psedomoas aeruginosa for 24 hr.
"The hygienic masks with menthol and tannin extracts were tested the bacterial inhibition property and the fungal infection at room temperature, hot, cold and humid conditions."
It was found that they can inhibited both types of the bacteria and it was not infected by fungal for 24 hr.
The satisfaction of user was tested by 20 persons.
It was found that the satisfaction was not significant different from the commercial mask product at (p=0.05)
