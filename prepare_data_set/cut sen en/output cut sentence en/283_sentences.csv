"This research presents an application of a hill climbing algorithm for optimum design of prestressed concrete plank girders in order to determine the design parameters based on the Engineering Institute of Thailand standard, E.I.T."
"1009-34, 2553 by strength design method for trucks HS20 - 44 according to AASHTO LRFD 1992 standards."
The algorithm was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and it was tested with 3 frequently-used examples.
The examples are single-span with the simply supported varied by length of girders.
The objective function is to find the lowest price.
"The design variable consists of the strength of concrete (fcâ€™) Yield strength of reinforcement steel (fy) Ultimate strength of prestressing strand (fpu) Sizes and quantities of reinforcing steel, Prestressing strand and the cross-sectional area of plank girder."
The statistical analysis revealed that the design of prestressed concrete plank girders by the hill climbing algorithm gave 11.17 % cheaper than when applying traditional methods.
