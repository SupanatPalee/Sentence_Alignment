This study was aimed to develop a highly thermal effective biomass charcoal kiln controlled by the Internet of things (IoT).
The kiln was designed from a 400-liter horizontal stainless steel tank.
"The internal wall was attached with 3 metal fins to circulate the heat inside the kiln, and insulation was installed to reduce the heat loss."
"The wood vinegar tube was connected to an air pollution disposal system, a wet scrubber tower with two ½ horsepower electric sprayers, and a one-horsepower air blower was installed to dispose non-condensable exhaust gas."
The activated charcoal filters were used to reduce air pollutants from the kiln.
The parameters of the kiln was controlled by smartphone via the Internet connection installed in the kiln.
All air entrances of the system were closed once the temperature reached the certain set points.
"The Eucalyptus firewood with a diameter of 4-6 centimeters and length of  60 centimeters were used to test the system, where the initial moisture content was at 13.20 %wet basis."
"It was found that the production process took 480 minutes, and the output biomass charcoal was 39.48% of the initial firewood weight."
The energy conversion efficiency was 40.39%.
A smartphone application was able to remotely control and track the system parameters during the experiment.
