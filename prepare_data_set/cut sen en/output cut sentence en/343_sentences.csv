"This research is to reduce waste production in the broom making process in order to increase the efficiency of the production process: a case study of community enterprise BUNG WAI, in Ubon Ratchathani."
"Starting from the flow process chart, the time spent in each step and the distance used to move the production has a total of 29 steps which brought to the Why-Why chart showing the relationship between all possible problems and causes, including 7 wastes."
We found that there were too many problems from the work process complicated work methods and there is a risk of accidents from work methods designers study the jig / fixture to be used in the work after improvement.
By designing the clamping tool for use in separating the size of the coconut maw to be 40 and 50 cm in length respectively.
The device helps to reduce waste in the work process too much.
"The gripping device design helps employees work faster, less time-consuming while getting more work."
The results from the clamping device also reduce the activity of cutting the broom from the production process.
"In addition, the jigs designed to be used in sawing activities was used to prevent accidents from saw blades."
"The results showed that in the process of cutting the wire able to reduce staff from 2 people to 1 person, reduce waste from wire scraps and cycle time reduced from 46 minutes / shaft to 40 minutes / shaft, representing 13.04%."
