"This paper presents a comparative study of various sensors utilized in plant farming, with the objective of supplying farmers with valuable information for advancing precision agriculture practices."
"Four types of sensors including temperature, soil moisture, humidity and light sensors, are selected to measure the important factors for planting."
Different sensing technologies are considered.
They are installed in practical field within Ubon Ratchathani University campus.
"Data collected using IoT is used to compare in four aspects including cost, technical aspect, measurement result and durability."
The results lead to a guidance of these sensors application in practical.
