Heat exchangers form a vital part of absorption chillers.
Majority of research works utilizeLMTD (Log Mean Temperature Difference) methodfor their analysis anddevelopmentof absorptionchillers.
"However, this method has some limitations."
The fluid inlet and outlet temperaturesmust be known or readily determined from the energy balance equations.
The value of log meantemperature difference for the heat exchanger may then be determined.
"Practically, the outlettemperatures are unknown for the design of absorption chillers."
"If only the inlet temperatures areknown, use of the LMTD method requires an iterative procedure."
"This research work proposedan alternative approach, termed the effectiveness-NTU method."
"The study results show that coldfluid heat capacity rate is always higher than hot fluid heat capacity rate because of 3 factors.Firstly, the mass flow rate of solution leaving from absorber is always higher than the massflow rate of solution leaving from the generator."
"Secondary, the specific heat of LiBr solution isa function of solution concentration and the concentration of solution leaving from absorber isalways lower than the concentration of solution leaving from the generator."
"Thirdly, the fluidheat capacity rate is the product of mass flow rate and specific heat of LiBr solution."
This effectto the constraint of designed temperature outlets and also the performance of heat exchangerused in absorption chiller.
