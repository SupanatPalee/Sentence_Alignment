Condominium design is a complicated process.
"Numerous factors, such as the project's location, land size, price, suitable building shape, and anticipated profits, must be considered, and several building regulations further complicate the design process."
"Using traditional design methods, such as CAD and Spreadsheets, requires additional resources and leads to the possibility of human error."
This study presents the use of parametric design in designing condominiums and comparison with traditional methods by considering the proportion of sales area and profit.
"Parametric design can generate multiple options based on spatial relationships, calculation algorithms, and design parameters."
"By adjusting the design's initial parameters, discover potential solutions that meet the predefined objectives developed by Dynamo and Revit, characterized by linking variable data to the building's geometry."
A condominium with eight stories was used as a case study.
"The results demonstrate that the preliminary design's precision, convenience, speed, and scope can be used to make project investment decisions."
The conceptual model can also be used as an initial Building Information Modeling (BIM) model to communicate with those involved in the next project development phase.
"In addition, the proposed parametric model can enhance algorithms to help create solutions automatically as the generate design for future research."
