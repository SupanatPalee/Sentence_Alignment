"This paper aims to the analyze and evaluate the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as a result of the development of Light Rail Transit (LRT), Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) as well as others supporting measures such as the improvement of the feeder systems and integrated ticket system in Khon Kaen town planning area."
This research applied the Multimodal Travel Demand Model (MTDM) to estimate the travel demands in the study area in the year 2019 to 2049 and also adopt the Bottom-Up 2 method to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions under various Â set up scenarios.
"From the analysis result, it was found that when the LRT, TOD and other supporting measure development were implemented in 2021, 2025, 2029, 2039 and 2049 the magnitudes of CO2 emissions would reduce (when compared to the without project cases in the same year, equal to 1,296 (0.5%) 16,610 (6.1%) 36,430 (11.9%) 53,848 (13.3%) and 63,588 (13.3%) tons per year, respectively."
"In addition, in the 30 years period (from 2019 to 2049), the summation of the CO2 emission reduction will be approximately 1.23 million tons."
