"The purposes of this study were to experiment and create an innovative ball formula for rice cultivation, and test the physical properties of clay before and after firing."
The data from documents and sources were studied to obtain as much information as possible to have clear and definite information for the possibility of the innovation.
There were two stages of the experiment.
"First, the formula of the ingredients was investigated by specifying 3 types of raw materials: local clay, rice husk ash, coffee grounds ash, and activated carbon (20 Percent)."
The frequency of raw materials was setting at 5-90 percent.
The materials were mixed and formed according to the specified ratio.
"Second, the physical properties of stoneware clay were tested both before firing and after firing at 800°C."
Then the mixture formula was selected.
"The most suitable physical properties were formula 7, with the mixture of  local clay 30, rice husk ash 35 percent, coffee grounds ash 35 percent and activated carbon 20 percent."
"After firing, the shrinkage was 18.21 percent, strength (kg/cm3) 1 percent, water absorption 92.05 percent and ability of water absorption 92.05 percent, and fire resistant."
"Then the mixture was molded by hand into the forms of 4 spherical balls: 1 centimeter, 2 centimeters, 3 centimeters, and 4 centimeters."
"In conclusion,  the results showed that the clay could maintain shape after firing and be molded with a specified shape."
It could be used for real practice and produced by a simple forming process without having to rely on technology.
"Also, it could be extended  to produce for sale as specified."
