The purpose of this study was to investigate service user queuing behavior of customers at service points and problem analysis of service system at SAPHAN-TAKSIN BTS station by study of simulation for queuing system using PTV VIiswalk.
"Case study, the critical point of service is the ticket office and Ticket Issuing Machine (TIM)."
With station space restrictions which has a different building structure from the general station.
The research therefore simulated 2 scenarios in order to find suitable solutions.
This research compared the original scenario with scenario 1 and scenario 2.
"According to PTV Viswalk, there is indicators consist of aggregated total average time in queue of each model and total average queue length of each model."
All parameters indicate that the model 1 is the most efficient model.
It has been renovated by adding 1 ticket office and 2 ticket vending machines (TVM) at Exit 1-2 and Exit 3-4.
Which had the minimum average queuing time was 25.54 seconds and the minimum average queuing length was 0.53 people.
