This article presents the results of a study on the efficiency of backanalysis for the strength of road structure containing soil-cement base using micro-genetic algorithms.
Field data are collected from the test sections constructed in Chachoengsao Province.
The population sizing is determined by the simplified approach depending on the string length.
It has been found that large population with generous computational resources results in higher accuracy.
"But the disadvantages are that it takes longer time and the approximate last 10,000 function evaluations may not be worth the added computation cost."
While large population with limited computational resources is appropriate for practical application and the accuracy is within acceptable range.
It is clear in these results that the micro-GA performed best with population size equals to 7 for this case study.
