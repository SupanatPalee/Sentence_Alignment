The use of local materials or off-specification materials stabilized with cement for minimizingnatural resource and environmental impacts is one of the cost-effective solutions in highwayconstruction and rehabilitation.
"If the cement content and the 7-day unconfined compressivestrength (UCS) of cement stabilized materials can be estimated prior to the mix design process,this will provide the practitioners with a guideline for local material selection and suitable amountof cement to meet the UCS according to the design specification."
This paper is to evaluate theempirical equations for predicting the UCS of three types of cement stabilized materials e.g.
"(1)cement modified crushed rock base, (2) pavement recycling base, and (3) soil-cement subbase.Since there was no standard and acceptable method for predicting the 7-day UCS of cementstabilized materials at the present in Thailand, the prediction equations proposed by Sunitsakulet al."
and Kasidit et al.
were considered in this study to estimate the UCS of these three typesof cement stabilized materials.
"Based on 270 test data, a comparison between the UCS obtainedfrom the laboratory tests and that obtained from the prediction equations suggested that anequation by Sunitsakul et al."
was more accurate and precise than that of Kasidit et al.
