The purpose of this research is to study the creep deformation behavior of the Bambusa blumeana.
The study was carried out by restraining the bamboo beam under moisture condition and constant temperature.
"Three level of loads were applied to the specimens respectively i.e.,—10%, 20% and 30%—of the maximum load."
Each level of load was applied for 4 hours.
"It was found that when the testing objects were loaded, their shape suddenly changed and continued changing slowly as time increased."
The maximum value at the end of the testing time.
"Moreover, the Bailey-Norton Creep Law successfully describes the main feature for the investigated material and shows good agreement with experimental creep data with R2 more than 0.994."
