This paper presents the comparison of compensating current controllers of Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF) for single-phase power systems.
"The three compensating current controllers: PI controller, Hysteresis controller and Predictive controller are compared."
Hardware in loop simulation technique by Simulink/MATLAB program and TMS320C2000TM Experimental Kit DSP board is applied for the testing of controllerâ€™s performance.
The total harmonic distortion percentage (%THDi) value of the source current after compensation is considered to indicate the performance of three controllers.
The simulation results show that the compensating currents of SAPF controlled by the three controllers are tracked the reference current correctly even though the system load was changed.
The %THDi of the source current after compensation from all controllers are decreased and satisfied under the IEEE std 519-2014.
Where the predictive controller provides the best result %THDi value.
"In addition, when the signal of reference current has high slope shapes, the predictive and hysteresis controllers have response sensitivity in tracking the reference current more than the PI controller."
