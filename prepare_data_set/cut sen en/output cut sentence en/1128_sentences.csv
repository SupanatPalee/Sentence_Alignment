"At present, although cricket farming becomes increasingly popular, the main problem of cricket farming is that the farmer has to take great care of, especially, giving water and feeding."
"Therefore, this research work aims to apply the Internet of things to cricket farming."
"There are three main parts, i.e., a feeding system, a water supply system and a control system via Internet of Things."
The feeding system was designed for proper feed dispersion by filling cricket feed into a PVC pipe and drilling holes along the pipe.
"When the PVC pipe is rotated, the feed falls into the feed rack below."
The water supply system was designed to automatically fill the water when the water level was lower than the pre-set level.
"The control system via the mobile application consisted of a feeding command, temperature and relative humidity."
"Besides, the picture was taken as demand to be shown through Line application."
"In the experiment, 600 crickets were raised with the traditional method and 600 crickets were raised with the proposed method."
The experimental results showed that the proper speed for rotating a PVC pipe is 71.5 rpm.
"Then, after 30 days of cricket raising, the number of crickets survived by raising with the traditional method and the proposed method was 450 and 530, respectively."
"The average weight of one cricket obtained from the traditional and proposed methods are 0.65 +/- 0.18 g and 0.71 +/- 0.15 g, respectively."
"Therefore, the proposed method can increase the number of survival crickets and the weight."
"Likewise, it can reduce labor demand in cricket farming."
