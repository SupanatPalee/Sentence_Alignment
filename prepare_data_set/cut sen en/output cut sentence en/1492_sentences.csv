"The aim of this research is to study the performance of moving average control chart (MA) for monitoring process change with span size (w) are equal 3, 4 and 5, respectively when observations are zero truncated Poisson (ZTP)."
"In addition, the performance of the control chart between MA and  charts are measured by average run length (ARL) using Monte Carlo simulation method."
The results show that the efficiency of MA control chart increases as the value of span size (w) increases.
The comparison between MA and  control charts shows that MA control chart is more efficient in detecting small changes in the process but  control chart is more efficient in detecting large changes in the process.
