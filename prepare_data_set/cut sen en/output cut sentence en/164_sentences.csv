This research aimed to study the suitability of agricultural product transportation in Tak Province by distribution centers (DCs).
"For the research implementation, the researchers studied the data of agricultural products in Tak Province."
"Then, we developed a mathematical model to solve the agricultural product transportation problem for the minimum transportation expenses."
"This was considered together with truck sizes by using 3 transportation models, i.e, Model 1: The regular direct transportation from origins to destinations, Model 2: Transportation by DCs, and Model 3: Transportation by DCs and direct transportation."
"The researcher collected the data of agricultural products from Tak Provincial Agricultural extension Office for 4 years between 2017 â€“ 2020, and designed the samples of 2 datasets for testing the results of changeable answers when product volumes and consumer demands changed."
"Next, the mathematical models were revised together with the data of the datasets by AMPL."
GUROBI was used as a problem-solving tool and a valid method.
"After that, the results were brought for expense analysis."
It was found that Model 3: Transportation by DCs and direct transportation generated minimum transportation cost.
