The synthesis and properties of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxymethyl cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol (CMC/PVA) blend films from rice straw were investigated.
The synthesis of CMC consisted of 2 steps.
"In the first step, cellulose was extracted from rice straw via delignification and bleaching processes using NaOH and H2O2, respectively."
"In the second step, CMC was synthesized by etherification of cellulose using NaOH and monochloroacetic acid."
The results showed that the maximum value of DS was 0.49 at the concentration of NaOH was 30%w/v and ratio of cellulose : MCA was 1:1.4.
"Then, CMC and CMC/PVA films with different PVA contents (12.5 -50 %w/w) were prepared by solvent casting method."
"Testing of physical properties revealed that higher PVA contents lead to a decrease in the film thickness, whereas the solubility and transparency value increased."
CMC/PVA films exhibited lower water vapor permeability as compared to CMC film.
The mechanical property tests indicated that the tensile strength of CMC film could be improved by the addition of PVA.
The maximum tensile strength of 20.05 Mpa was obtained from CMC/PVA(12.5).
The weight loss of CMC and CMC/PVA was higher than 50% after soil burial for 10 days.
"In addition, CMC/PVA(12.5) could be used as a biodegradable plant grow bag."
