This research aims to study the effects of cracked concrete that affects the adhesive anchoring system using a three-dimensional finite element model.
Adhesive anchoring system under the pull-out force was modeled under cracked condition with different vertical cracks zone.
"The failure response of anchor model, adhesive model and concrete model are defined failure response types Ductile Damage, Shear Damage and Concrete Damage Plasticity Model respectively."
For the model of adhesive/concrete interface are used cohesive elements and defined failure response type Traction-Separation Behavior.
"The results showed that when the position of cracked in concrete is deep, their behavior and the pull-out strength of the adhesive anchor was closed to the case of adhesive anchor in the uncracked concrete."
The effect of the crack zone was increased when the cracks were closed to the top surface of the concrete.
The cracks under the embedding phase do not affect the behavior and strength of the system.
It also found that increasing of the cracked plane of one-plane and two-plane would result in the reduction of maximum pull-out strength by 25% and 39% respectively.
