"This research aims to study and design a water-drinking meter for chickens, displaying results through an IoT system (DWMCs)."
The device is created using a microcontroller to control pressure-sensing sensors for measuring water volume.
Data is presented through the Internet of Things (IoT) using NETPIE's Cloud Platform service.
Testing the DWMCs compared to standard meters in measuring water volume in a laboratory setting revealed an average percentage error of 1.32%.
This indicates that the DWMCs have a low percentage error in measuring water volume and can be used to test chicken drinking behavior.
"In practical application tests, measuring chicken water consumption using DWMCs compared to standard meters showed an average percentage error of 1.35%."
"The research concludes that DWMCs can be applied for beneficial measuring chicken water consumption, and users can monitor chicken drinking behavior through the internet at any time."
