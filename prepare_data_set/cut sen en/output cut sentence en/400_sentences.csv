This research aimed to reduce the defective form carton box process using industry engineering technique for categorizing the potential causes of a problem to obtain defective in the carton box process.
"Response Surface Experiment was used to design the experiment by three factors consisting of 1) Speed machine at 170-190 m/min, 2) Glue gap at 370-400 micron, and 3) Glue Machine at 380-390 microns with significance at 0.05."
"The summarized results were suitable parameters for setting up the machine in producing carton box where the speed at 190 meters/ minute, the glue gap at 390 microns, and the glue Machine at 385 effects to highly compressive force at 103.27 kg."
f/cm2Â and reduce defective brittle paper.
"The before improvement result shows a defective ratio average of 5.86%, and after improvement using Response Surface Experiment (Box-Behnken) result shows a defective ratio average of 1.83 %."
"So, the summarized results were as follows before improving the total monthly defective ratio average of 7.33%."
The brittle paper was mostly defective to reduce after improvement.
"The total defective (Monthly) ratio was also reduced by 3.28%, and the manufacturer can do meet the target that the Total monthly defective ratio average of less than 4.5%."
