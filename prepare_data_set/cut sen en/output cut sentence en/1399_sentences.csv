The accessibility of skeletal tracking using by Kinect camera has facilitated the research in Thai sign language recognition.
This paper proposes an application of backpropagation neural network for Thai sign language recognition based on skeletal motion tracking.
Experimental results of all 5 standard Thai sign language proposed the image recognition algorithm for Thai sign language translation yields accuracy greater than 88%.
