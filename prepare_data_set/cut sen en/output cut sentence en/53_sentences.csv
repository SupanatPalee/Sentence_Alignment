"The main purpose of this research was to study the electrical resistivity development of concrete in the first three days, by using a measurement tool developed in this work."
"Test variables included the water to binder ratio, the addition of superplasticizer, and the replacement of Portland cement by silica fume or fly ash, or both."
Concrete properties measured included electrical resistivity as a function of time and 3-day compressive strength.
Test results showed that the development curve of the electrical resistivity of concrete can be divided into two periods: 1) the setting period with slow change of resistivity and 2) the hardening period with a sharp increase of resistivity.
Boundary between the two periods located at the point of resistivity drop.
"At the age of 3 day, it was found that the electrical resistivity of concrete strongly decreased with an increase in water to binder ratio, slightly decreased in the presence of fly ash and silica fume, and markedly increased with the use of superplasticizer."
"In general view, the 3-day compressive strength was found to have a linear correlation with the resistivity, indicating that there is a high possibility to predict the compressive strength of concrete by measuring its electrical resistivity."
