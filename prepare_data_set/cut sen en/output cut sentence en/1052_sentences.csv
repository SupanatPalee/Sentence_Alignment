"The purposes of this research are to 1) study common sculptures, 2) create a sculpture on plaster, 3) assess the satisfaction in sculpture created on plaster, and 4) integrate the knowledge with teaching and learning in the undergraduate classroom, Design Department."
"In this study, there were four steps in research methodology."
"In Step 1, the common sculptures were studied."
"In Step 2, clay was molded to form the desired shape and glue was used to attach the molded sculpture with the square-shaped plaster."
"In Step 3, the consumersâ€™ satisfaction in the creation of the sculpture on the plaster was assessed on these aspects: materials, design, and functions."
"In Step 4, the knowledge was integrated with the teaching and learning in the undergraduate classroom, Design Department."
The research was found that in general most of consumers were satisfied with the creation of plaster on the plaster at the high level.
"On the material aspect, it was found that the materials used were suitable for the sculpture creation on plaster at the high level."
This is because the color of the Japanese clay used was the same as the color of plaster which was white.
"When the sculpture was attached, it became harmonious."
"On the design aspect, it was found that the level of the sculpture creativity was high because the work made of Japanese clay which could be molded independently was different from other sculptures commonly seen."
The concepts of designing were unique.
"On the functional aspect, applying in the classroom, it was found that the level of this aspect was high."
"This is because at the undergraduate level in Design Department, there is a course of materials and production processes, so the knowledge of creating sculpture on plaster can be integrated with teaching and learning both in theory and in practice."
