This research proposes a framework for prioritizing overcoming organizational barriers in implementing electronic document management systems (EDMS) by applying multi-criteria decision-making approach.
Twelve barriers and ten overcoming solutions are identified through extensive relevant literature review.
"In this study, the combination weights by integrating subjective weights and objective weights are used to calculate the importance weights of barriers factors."
"Subjective weights are computed by “Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)”, while objective weights are computed by “Coefficient of Variation (COV)”."
“Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” approach is utilized to prioritize the overcoming solutions.
A sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed framework.
One of the autonomous universities is uses as a case study to collect the required data.
"Furthermore, others organizations that aim to implement EDMS system can similarly apply the propose framework in this study to prioritize their overcoming solutions."
