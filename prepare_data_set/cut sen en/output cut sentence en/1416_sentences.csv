This paper presents the development of special laboratory in the online course of electrical network analysis which students can design the circuits and develop them for practical prototype in forms of online learning through Google Meet and Google Classroom as known “Work/Study from home” in the coronavirus pandemic.
The online course consists of two steps as 1) To design and simulate by electrical analysis software 2) To design the printed circuit board for practical prototype.
"The objective of this development is that can help the students to design, create and make the practical innovation by using the online outcome-based learning and KAPIS evaluation."
