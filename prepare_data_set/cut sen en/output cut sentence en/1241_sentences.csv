"Although road condition data, e.g."
"visual distress and ride quality, provide a good indication of the overall network-level road condition, it does not give a direct measure of structural integrity and capacity of a road pavement."
"To address this issue, the road structural condition parameters based on the falling weight deflectometer (FWD) measurements are proposed and implemented in the road deterioration model for Thailand pavement management system (PMS)."
"This paper highlights the practical implication of structural condition parameters suggested in the past publications for road maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction."
"The preliminary analysis of this study showed that the FWD was the most comprehensive approach for road structural condition assessment and road deterioration model for Thailand pavement performance prediction, which was an integral part of PMS."
"The Department of Highways, Thailand aims to reduce road deterioration and maintenance cost through using improved PMS which employs the road deterioration model uniquely developed based on Thailand road conditions."
