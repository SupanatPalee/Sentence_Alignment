"Ubon Ratchathani province experiences flooding in every year and experienced the major floods in 1978, 2002, 2010 and 2019, however it still lacks a flood warning system."
"Then, the objectives of this study are (1) to analyze the runoff stations to warn flooding, (2) to prepare a flood warning diagram using stream flow data and satellite images, and (3) to assess the resulting flood area in Ubon Ratchathani province with the MIKE FLOOD model."
"The study areas are the Chi River (starting from Station E.20A), the Mun River (starting from M. 5 station to Pak Mun Dam), and the floodplains, from Mueang Nakhon Ubon Ratchathani District, Warin Chamrap District, Phibul Mangsahan District, and ending at Pak Mun Dam."
There are two parts of the methodology.
"Firstly, to determine runoff stations for flood warning and a flood warning diagram, the data of water level, discharge, and satellite image are analyzed using the statistics."
"Secondary, MIKE FLOOD model is applied for flooding area."
"The results showed that (1) runoff stations that is important to warn flooding are included M.5, M.9, M.182, M.7, M.170, E.20A, and E.98."
(2) The flood warning diagram can be used as a guideline for water management before flooding and during flooding without calculating the water level and discharge from the mathematical model.
"This flood warning diagram shows the water level and discharge for flood warnings in 3 cases included case 1: starts a flooding, case 2: critical flooding, and case 3: great floods ever occurred."
"Finally, (3) the flooding area in Ubon Ratchathani province for cases 1, 2, and 3 are 113.22 km2, 192.18 km2 and 293.55 km2, respectively."
