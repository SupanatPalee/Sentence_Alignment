"This research aims to study the effect of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) and limestone powder (LP) on threshold chloride content, the depassivation time of steel and compressive strength of concrete containing GGBFS and LP."
"The GGBFS was used as a partial replacement of binder at the replacement percentage of 30%, 40%, 50% and 70% and LP was used to replace the binder at the replacement percentage of 5%, 10% and 15%."
The water to binder ratio of 0.50 and covering depth of 2 cm were used.
The results showed that the threshold chloride content and depassivation time of concrete containing GGBFS and LP was higher than that of cement-only concrete.
Concrete with GGBFS had lower threshold chloride content and longer depassivation time with increasing binder replacement content by GGBFS.
"The use of LP at 5% binder replacement in concrete containing GGBFS gave higher compressive strength of concrete, longer depassivation time of steel and higher corrosion resistance index of steel in concrete."
This research aims to examine and control the factors affecting the overall efficiency of horizontal packaging machines.
The study focuses on the KM1200 RB horizontal packaging machine and applies principles of overall machine efficiency.
It involves analyzing defects and their impact and addressing identified issues to enhance the efficiency of the horizontal packaging machine.
The current machine operates at 77.30% efficiency.
"Data analysis revealed that the main problems are blade wear on the End Cutter Sealer, broken notches that secure the sealing face, and cracked sealing faces, all stemming from the inability of the End Cutter Sealer to cut the pouches."
"To address these issues, two main improvements were implemented."
"Firstly, recommendations and knowledge sharing about blade maintenance for the End Cutter Sealer were introduced."
"Secondly, a self-maintenance plan was enhanced to check the blade level and provide knowledge to employees about blade maintenance."
"After these improvements, the efficiency of the horizontal packaging machine increased to 82.32%, indicating a 5.02% improvement in machine efficiency."
This discovery provides valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency of horizontal packaging machines and highlights the effectiveness of defect analysis and impact assessment in identifying critical factors affecting machine efficiency.
