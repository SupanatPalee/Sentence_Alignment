The research aims to determine the minimum number of carriers to be used in pneumatic tube drug delivery by applying simulation and optimization for planning the improvement of the emergency (stat) drug delivery system by a pneumatic tube for inpatient wards in Songklanagarind Hospital.
"Because it is not possible to experiment or modify the actual work system, simulation is the best tool."
And optimization is adopted to determine the appropriate scenario before it is put into practice that will allow the improvement of the pneumatic tube system to achieve the desired results of the hospital.
"From the simulation and optimization results, it was found that 39 carriers could minimize the waiting time for the carriers at the station of the pneumatic tube system, and the delivery of stat drugs can be achieved within the time required by the hospital."
