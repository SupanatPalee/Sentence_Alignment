This research utilizes pomelo peel char obtained from the pyrolysis process as a catalytic support for KOH by introducing it into the biodiesel production from the used oils via the tranesterification.
"Various parameters were studied including the ratio of methanol and used oil, temperature,time, amounts of catalysts, and types of catalytic systems (homogeneous and heterogenous)."
"It was found that the optimized condition for the production was at the oil to methanolratioof 1:6, 60oC, 1 hour and 2 wt.% KOH with the homogeneous system, giving the highest biodiesel yield of 90.01 %."
"For the heterogeneous system, the highest yield was obtained with 4 wt.% KOH of catalyst, giving biodiesel yield of 87.38 %."
"Nevertheless, the heterogeneous catalysts are more suitable for practical production due to easier catalyst separation."
"Therefore, the chemical components of the biodiesel produced from the heterogeneous catalysts with 4 % wtKOH was then analyzed with the GC-MS for its chemical composition, which included methyl oleate, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, metyl palmitelaidate."
"In addition, this biodiesel had the properties i.e."
"density, viscosity, flash point and acidity meeting the European standard of biodiesel (EN 14214) and the standard of the Department of Energy Business, Ministry of Energy."
