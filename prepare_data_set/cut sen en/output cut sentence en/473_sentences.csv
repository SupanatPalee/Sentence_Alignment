"The purpose of this research is to draw up a design, improve and construct a plastic waste incinerator."
"To produce fuel with a ceramic insulated reactor and not insulated the research results were divided into 2 parts: 1) physical properties of the product, 2) the effect of ceramic fiber insulated and non-insulated reactors."
"To analyze the effect of temperature, quantity, density, heat generated in the production process of fuel from plastic waste."
along with studying the optimum conditions in the production process of fuel from plastic waste.
"It was found that the color of oil from PP, LDPE and HDPE was yellow, and the color of PS oil was orange."
"The fuel from PS, PP, LDPE and HDPE were 2.14, 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21, with the temperature between the formation of the flame is 390.3, 385.6, 431.7 and 422.9 degrees Celsius respectively, when compared to general market fuel."
Diesel was found to be incapable of igniting and Gasohol 91 had the shortest flame duration.
"The pyrolysis temperature at the optimum average heating rate was between 2.75–6 °C/min, which resulted in complete degradation of the plastic structure."
The product is most liquid fuel.
"The density of the fuel was in the range of 0.698–0.811 g/cm3 and the color of the obtained oil was similar, But the amount of oil and the calorific value of fuel from a furnace insulated with 1inch thick ceramic fiber was only slightly higher than that of a non-insulated furnace where LPG wasted in heating the furnace 0.75 kg  by the volume of oil obtained and heat value Of PS plastic waste, the highest was 895 or the percentage of yield was 89.5% and 43.67 MJ/kg, respectively."
It was found that these approximate components were in the same range as the relevant research.
"Therefore, the production process of fuel from plastic waste with ceramic fiber insulated reactor."
"It is suitable as a tool to produce fuel from plastic waste, because it saves more energy and obtain more fuel products, to be an alternative fuel or to replace the fuel sold in the general market."
