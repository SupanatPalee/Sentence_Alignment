The purpose of this  research of this was to study the efficiency of Spirulina sp.
"RMUTL for removal wastewater by using  printer  waste at the concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%."
"The results showed that,  the suitable waste concentration for maximum growth of Spirulina sp."
RMUTL was 20%.
"The maximum removal efficiency was measured as TSS, BOD, COD, Total Nitrogen (TN) and  Total Phosphorus (TP)  values of 10.26±2.22, 34.78±0.57,  44.53±1.13,  55.79±1.90 and 17.59±0.58%,  respectively."
The  maximum growth of Spirulina sp.
"RMUTL was OD560 0.54±0.02  and specific growth rate was  0.31±0.02 day-1,  and the lipid content average was 6.56±0.09% by dry weight."
