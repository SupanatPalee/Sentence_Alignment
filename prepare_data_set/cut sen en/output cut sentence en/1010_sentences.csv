This research aims to develop biomass dryers with flame thermal conductivity techniques and smoke does not come into direct contact with food through heat exchangers.
"There is an increasing trend in cancer cases in Thailand, particularly stomach and colon cancer."
"Most of these cases are caused by the consumption of toasted, grilled, smoked, and fried foods."
"Frying specifically use oil repeatedly, that produce carcinogenic substances such as Heterocyclic Amines and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon."
The rainy season is also a problem in food preparation.
Lack of sunshine and the wet weather result to poor quality food products.
The dryer will allow use of heathier cooking and food preparation methods.
The drying chamber has a capacity of 10 kg.
"It is has a heat exchanger between the combustion and drying zones, which allow for conduction, convection, and radiation heating techniques."
Tree branches are used as fuel.
Pork meat is used to test the biomass dryer performance.
"Drying is done at temperatures of 55, 60 and 65 ֯C and the air velocity inside the drying chamber varies at 1.0, 3.0 and 6.0 m/s."
"The studies showed that increasing drying temperature or air velocity result in an increase in the specific energy consumption (ranging of 0.12 – 0.29 kg of tree branches/hr), resulting to higher drying rate of between 0.05 – 0.08 MJ/kg."
The dryer developed in this research can easily be moved allowing production of sun-dried pork anywhere at any time.
"However, it is still necessary to operate the dryer indoors for rainy season"
