This research aims to find factors that affect the success of the manufacturer's transportation.
For modern retail businesses and to evaluate the most suitable alternatives for manufacturers to participate in transportation.
We solely study Joint Delivery System from the perspective of producers alone.
"Thus, to reach the goal of the project, we need to study five factors that relate to transportation process which are capital, credibility, operating process, flexibility, and environmental effects by using Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) to compare and value each factor respectively."
We also provide questionnaire to experts and producers of different companies to give marks on each factor and evaluate options for the most appropriate delivery system to adopt in Thailand.
The results of questionnaire done by experts and producers who are interested in Joint Delivery System (JDS) producers and companies all agree that the use of hub as a storage center for goods is the most suitable option for Joint Delivery System today.
