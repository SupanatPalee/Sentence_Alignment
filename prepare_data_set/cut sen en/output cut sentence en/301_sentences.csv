Silk fabric was dyed with natural extract from cassava leaves (CaL).
"Ferric chloride (FeCl3.6H2O), alum (AlK(SO4)2.12H2O), and salt (NaCl) were used as mordant."
Silk fabrics were dyed at 90 Â°C for 60 minutes.
"Then, the UV-protection efficiency of a fabric is defined by its Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF)."
The chemical functional groups of the dyes were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
The results show that Silk fabric dyed with cassava leaves showed a shade of grey.
Ferric chloride and salt as mordants exhibited a black grey colour and had excellent UV protection resulted from polyphenol and tannin which was extracted from cassava leaves.
