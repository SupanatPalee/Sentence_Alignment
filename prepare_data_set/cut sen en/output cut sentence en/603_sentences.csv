Water hyacinth (Eichhornia Speciosa Kunth) causes ecological problems in Thailand.
Variousalternatives have been made to utilize its existence.
"One of the alternatives is biogas fuel because of its cellulose, nitrogen, essential nutrients, and high fermentation contents."
This study aimed to enhance the biogas production potential using integrated solar radiation and co-digestion with food waste.
A series of laboratory experiments using biodigester was performed in batch anaerobic operation at room temperature.
The pretreatment process was done in 40 days and co-digestion with food waste.
The optimum condition from the batch scale experiment was selected into operation in the continuous flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR).
The result showed that solar radiation and co-digestion could enhance the biogas production potential up to 40 %.
"The best performance of biogas production from this research will be obtained if the co-digestion ratio is in 80:20 with treated water hyacinth as the main substrate, OLR 2.5 Kg VS/m3 day and HRT in 10 days."
