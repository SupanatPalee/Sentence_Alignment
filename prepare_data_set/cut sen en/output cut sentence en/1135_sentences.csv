"This research is to develop of the automatic pouring raw milk storage tank machine which it is able to work large quantities, reduce human labor, save time and reduce costs of raw milk collection process."
PLC (Programmable Logic Control) programming and PLC devices were used to control to the pneumatic system.
"The experiment was set at the time to pour the milk storage tank from 5 to 15 seconds, the raw milk in the storage tank of 40 liters and the air pressure of the pneumatic system at 7 bar."
"From the result, it was found that the time setting was effected to the raw milk pouring when the set time to longer, raw milk can pour out which no dew in the storage tank."
It was found that the time of pouring raw milk at 10 seconds can be pouring out of the storage tank was 100% of the raw milk.
For the time of all process for pouring raw milk storage tank was 30 second (completely process) that the automatic pouring raw milk storage tank machine can work at the rate of 120 tank/hr.
