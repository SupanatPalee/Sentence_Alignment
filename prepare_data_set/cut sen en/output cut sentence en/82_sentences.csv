This study aims to explore soil moisture data sources and review various techniques for obtaining soil moisture data from remote sensing technology.
"Results reveal available data sources that allow users to access, download and manipulate the soil moisture data via the internet."
Remote sensing techniques and their related methods for extracting the soil moisture data are also mentioned.
"According to the demonstrated result, the use of soil moisture data can be applied to the engineering and environmental application, burning area, and air pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) management and disaster monitoring efficiently."
