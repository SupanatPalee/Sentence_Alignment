"This research aims to examination and analysis of cybernetic paradigms, development of a new cybernetic-based adventure game and evaluation of the result of prototype games under the usability testing framework."
"The sample group consisted of game experts (designers, developers, computer graphics) traffic experts, experimental pilot studies and the game testers."
"The research tools included the following list: specialist interview questions, the prototype game developed from the synthesis, the prototype game developed from cybernetic paradigms, and performance appraisal form."
"The results were divided into, a simple linear regression analysis could be adapted to utilize with cybernetics in assessing a player’s ability, applied artificial intelligence (AI) to a player’s abilities to create an engagement."
"Secondly, the development of a new adventure game based on cybernetics helped get a player rating system to adjust the difficulty of the game according to a player’s abilities, the evaluation results of the prototype game under the usability testing framework were overall positive, with a point average 4.07 which meets the objective fulfillment."
