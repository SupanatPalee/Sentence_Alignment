"In this research, we study the electronic structure and optical properties of the right triangular quantum dot."
"Using effective mass approximation, we solve the schrӧdinger equation to obtain analytic solutions of the eigenenergies as well as eigenfunctions and use them to calculate the oscillator strength and absorption coefficients."
We found that the probability densities of the transition due to x-polarized and y-polarized light have the same distribution pattern.
"After considering linear and nonlinear absorption coefficients, it is found that the resonant peaks show redshift phenomenon when the system size increases."
The absorption from the ground state to the first excited state is dominant when the system size is less than 20 nm.
While that from the ground state to the second excited state is dominant when the system size is greater than 20 nm.
This is because of increasing magnitude of the nonlinear term.
The optical properties we find will bring benefits to designing novel optoelectronic devices.
