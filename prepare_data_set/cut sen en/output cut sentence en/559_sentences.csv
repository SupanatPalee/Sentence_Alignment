Utilization of antibacterial packaging is an approach to maintain and extend shelf-life of foods.
"This research aims to develop the bioactive composite paper coating with bioactive compound viz, silver-iron oxide particles (Ag/Fe3O4)."
Starch waste from cassava starch industry and tannic acid are used as bio reducing agents for synthesis of Ag/Fe3O4.
The effect of tannic acid concentration at 0-3 %w/v is studied.
"Based on the study, the increase of tannic acid concentration for coating of paper enhances tensile strength, water resistance and antibacterial activities i.e."
Staphylococcus aureus: S.aureus and  Escherichia coli: E.coli.
The coated paper with Ag/Fe3O4 at 3% w/v of tannic acid could maintain vitamin C and delay the ripening of tomatoes.
"Therefore, the obtained packaging had potential to apply as bioactive packaging to maintain food quality and prolong the shelf-life."
