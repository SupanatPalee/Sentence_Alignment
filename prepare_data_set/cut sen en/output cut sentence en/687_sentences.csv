This paper present current based algorithm for the maximum power point tracking of stand-alone system.
The proposed algorithm can improve the tracking performance compared with the conventional perturb and observe (P&O) method.
The current based algorithm directly uses the change of photovoltaic current.
"As a result, the response and the achieved power are better than there of the P&O method."
"To verify the advantage of the proposed algorithm, the simulation via MATLAB and the experimental results from the hardware implementation are used."
The results show that the current based algorithm can provide the better performance in both transient and steady-state response compared with the P&O method.
