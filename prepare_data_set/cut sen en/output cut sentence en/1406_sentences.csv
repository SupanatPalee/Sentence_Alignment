In this paper presents the implementation of a real-time temperature monitoring system for foam rubber.
This system has been used in the drying process of rubber foam to transform it into other materials for a higher value.
Temperature monitoring is necessary to monitor dynamics and quality control of rubber foam curing.
The temperature measurement system can see the results of the change at any time until the end of the baking process through the website.
