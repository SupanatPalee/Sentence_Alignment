A laboratory jaw crusher was investigated on the different discharge gap parameters.
The results found that a small gap has finer particle size distribution and higher breakage probability.
Five mathematic models were tested to find the best regression coefficient.
"Furthermore, computing the shape parameter sensitivity was examined by GRG Nonlinear method."
The Nikolov (2002) model was the best for this experiment.
These results lead to the ANN of the mineral comminution circuit in the future.
