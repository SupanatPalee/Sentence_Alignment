"The effect of plant-growth-regulators (PGR) on growth of Philodendron ‘Birkin’, used completely randomized design (CRD) 13 treatment, 10 repetitions."
"Microshoots from shoot tip (0.5-1 cm) were cultured on MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium supplemented with various concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/l) of N6-benzyladenine (BA) and Thidiazuron (TDZ) and with a combination of BA (1, 2 and 4 mg/l) with NAA (0.5 mg/l) was studied for 8 weeks."
"The highest number of shoots per explant (4.8 shoots and 4.7 shoots) was observed on the MS medium supplemented with 2 mg/l BA and 2 mg/l TDZ, respectively."
"MS medium without PGR had the highest shoot length at 1.88 cm, whereas the highest lengths of roots (2.75 cm) was obtained on the MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BA."
"Besides, the MS medium supplemented with 1 and 2 mg/l BA had the highest root number at 6.8 and 6.7 roots per explant, respectively."
This finding may be applied for mass propagation in short time period and conservation of natural resources for future.
