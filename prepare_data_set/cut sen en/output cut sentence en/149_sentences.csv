"This aims of this research is to study the supply chain model of the chili community enterprise in Hua Rue Subdistrict, Ubon Ratchathani Province."
The target group is the members of the community enterprise of chili in Hua Rue Subdistrict.
"Qualitative research tools such as in-depth interviews and focus groups will be used, and the questions will follow the guidelines of the SCOR Model, which is a tool used to measure the results of the supply chain management process."
"The study identified the following processes: 1) planning the quality and quantity of sales, 2) procurement by chili farmers and chili collectors from network members, 3) production, where farmers produce, send, and sell to local collectors and traders, 4) transportation, where farmers deliver chilies to gatherers by pickup trucks, and those who collect and sort chilies transport them to domestic and foreign customers by container ships, and 5) return where there is no product return."
"Customers purchase all the chili, but the price may vary depending on the customer."
"Alternatively, the aggregator may purchase all the chili at a price determined by the quality and the prevailing market price."
"Suggestions for improvement include setting output goals both quantitatively and qualitatively according to customer needs each year, planning transportation vehicles and routes, and providing concrete knowledge on growing chili to farmers through government agencies, including how to harvest and use the right amount of pesticides to meet the requirements of foreign customers."
"The study proposes a campaign for planting chili peppers to increase competitiveness, develop the capacity and strength of local communities to be efficient and effective, reduce costs, and increase income for local communities."
