This research about comparison of pavement design from field testing by Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) and Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD).
Used in road work to find the leaning of the road.
It is part of the Royal Route Development.
The test equipment was tested on Highway 344 (Chonburi - Banbung).
"In normal maintenance work, the structural condition of the track must be assessed with the impact crimp."
It works by releasing the weight on the surface.
The results are difference of percentage maximum is 56.78 % at station 8 and difference of percentage minimum is 0.19 % at station 11.
Factors that effect the road test are: The weight loss pad deflectometer (FWD) is 750 KPa and the Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) tool is 10 KPa.
