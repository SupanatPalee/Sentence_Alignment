The research objective is to determine optimum parameters for spot-welding in the automotive industry.
"At present, the auto body industry is facing the problem of spot-welding, in regard to spot welding parameter setting to achieve welds quality the production generally uses the experience of trial and error of the technician."
The skill of technicians in adjusting parameters but the value used for welding is not always the ideal value.
Adjusting the parameters for each machine is also difficult.
"There is also a complex factor involved in welding is current, force and time of welding etc."
"Therefore, from such problems."
The research operator has studied the theory to understand the relationship of parameter adjustment in the spot-welding process.
To create a set of spot-welding operations and perform experiments for optimal parameters.
"We can increase performance by designing a 2k level factorial experiment k = 3 factors: current, time, pressure."
"Experimental results of spot-welding, when the specimen is put to the shear tensile test it was compared with the standard of international vehicles from JIS Z 3140 standard."
"Shear tensile strength of aluminum alloy with a thickness of 1.00 mm, minimum 0.62 kN and the average value was 0.92 kN."
"The most suitable for spot-welding are the current at 17.50 kA, time 200 ms and the pressure at the electrode head 591.50 deka N, the mean shear tensile strength of 2.76 kN is the strength of the weld."
