The purpose of this research is to study the impact of safety measure on labor productivity in ceiling activity by studying 4 â€“ story 42 units residential buildings in Bangkok.
"The safety system composed of (1) stable scaffolding system, (2) providing clean and not slip walkways on the scaffold, (3) providing personal protective equipment for workers, (4) responsible for scaffolding and (5) scaffolding permit document."
"Productivity rates for prior and after the used of safety measure are 1.85 and 1.66 m2 /person/hr., respectively."
"The productivity declines for approximately 10.27 %, the working time for ceiling could take longer for 5.35 % and labor cost could increase for 10.26 %."
