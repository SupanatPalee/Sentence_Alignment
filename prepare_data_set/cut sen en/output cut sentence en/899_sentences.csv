"This research aimed to analyze the properties of clayed soil from the sediment trapping sump of Mae Moh mine, Lampang province for use in ceramics production."
The soil was sampled from the sump and cleaned by washing and removing the impurities.
The clayed soil was then analyzed for chemical and mineral compositions using X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction instruments.
"The main compositions were silica, alumina, and iron oxide in the forms of quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and hematite."
The clay soil had high plasticity because it contained more than 67% of fine particles.
"After firing at temperatures ranging from 1000-1200 o C, it was found that the clay body was sintered well at 1100 o C. The lost weight was 9.70% and the shrinkage value was 4.54%."
"It had porosity of 0.27%, water absorption of 1.40%, and a reddish-brown color after firing."
The strength was measured with a bending strength value of 13.38 MPa.
It was found that the clayed soil was suitable for hand molding or jiggering.
The resulting ceramics had properties like terracotta.
"Therefore, it is possible to use the clayed soil, a waste product from the sediment trapping sump in the Mae Moh mine, in the ceramic industry."
