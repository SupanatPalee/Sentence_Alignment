"The objective of this study is to determine the optimal conditions of the flame hardening process in AISI 1045 carbon steel using the Taguchi method consisted of three factors: surface hardening temperature, distance from the nozzle, and speed."
"The results showed that the temperature of 950 Â°C, the distance between the gas nozzle and the workpiece of 30 mm, and the rotation speed of 2 rpm were found to be the most optimal conditions, with the maximum surface hardness (HRC) of 54.12 and the lowest wear rate of 0.0582 g. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was found that all of the factors significantly affected the flame hardening process at a 95 percent confidence interval."
The findings of this study can be utilized to improve the surface characteristics of mechanical parts in order to improve their service life.
