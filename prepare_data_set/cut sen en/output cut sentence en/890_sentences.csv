"The purposes of this research were: 1) to study and analyze the problems that arise from use of the injection shaker prototype and the Injection Bottle Shaker version 2; 2) to design and construct the Injection Bottle Shaker version 3, which can reduce the problems and defects of the injection shaker prototype and the Injection Bottle Shaker version 2; and 3) to evaluate the efficiency of the Injection Bottle ShakerÂ  version 3."
The results of the efficiency test showed that the Injection Bottle Shaker version 3 had average shaking rates of 268 and 305 times per minute.
"The results of shaking the injection bottle 25 times showed that the device was able to shake the injection bottle to dissolve the powder in a minimum time of 1 minute (4%), 2 minutes (50%), 3 minutes (36%), and in a maximum time of 4 minutes (12%)."
"It had an operating noise level of 60.17 and 61.68 dBA, which meant the overall performance was higher compared to the injection shaker prototype and the Injection Bottle Shaker version 2."
