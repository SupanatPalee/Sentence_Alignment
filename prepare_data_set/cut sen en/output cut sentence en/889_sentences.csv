Limiting wrist mobilization within the first 24 hours after transradial cardiac catheterization is important to avoid potential complications.
The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop a naval wrist support to support the wrist of patients after transradial cardiac catheterization; and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of the naval wrist support.
The following research and development methods were used in this study: 1) analysis of problems and needs; 2) development of the naval wrist support; and 3) testing and evaluation of effectiveness.
"The samples were 20 professional nurses and patients in the cardiac intensive care unit of Somdech Phra Pinklao Hospital from July 2019 to August 2020, and the data were collected using a questionnaire."
The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
"The naval wrist support was made of acrylic with a rectangular shape at the bottom, padded with EVA foam with curved side edges."
"There was a closure and wrist strap on the top and on the bottom, and was available in four sizes: S, M, L, and XL."
Results showed that the naval wrist support is feasible for use in the care of patients after transradial cardiac catheterization ( =4.65 S.D.=0.43).
The nurses and patients were very satisfied with the use of the naval wrist support ( =4.51 S.D.=0.53 and ( =4.48 S.D.=0.37 respectively).
It can be concluded that the naval wrist support is an innovation in nursing that is beneficial for patients after transradial cardiac catheterization preventing complications and making patients safer.
