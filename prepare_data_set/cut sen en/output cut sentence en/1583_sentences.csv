"In this current research, we aimed at preparing the rice germ powder, developing the rice germ fortified protein, and exploring the proximate analysis."
"The different processes between preparation of cooked combined rice germ powder and rice germ powder mixed with traditional recipe of Naresuan Organic Agricultural Occupation Promotion Group (Wat Phrik, Phitsanulok) were also compared."
The results revealed that the adsorption and solubility abilities of mixed rice germ powder obtained by the cooked method were 1.72 and 4.20 times higher than that of the original one.
"In terms of developing prototype of protein-enriched combined rice germ powder by adding soy protein at five different dosage levels i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 % (w/w) and analyzing chemical composition, adding 10% soy protein provided higher protein content than traditional formula product, indicating that it is comparable to commercial rice germ powder products, The results of this study could be used as a guideline to enhance the nutritional value of combined rice germ powder products."
