"The packaging development for processed banana products in Nongtoom Sub-district, Kongkrairart District, Sukhothai Province aims to 1) study packaging for processed banana products, 2) develop packaging for processed banana products, and 3) evaluate consumers’ satisfaction towards the packaging development."
"In the first step, data research and collection, interviewing is applied to explore the problems and the demand in the community."
"Then the concept of drafting packaging based on four types of the best-selling banana products; butter banana, paprika banana, banana rolls, and banana chips, is determined and designed."
"In the design process, the concept of using parts of bananas is applied."
The evaluation form conducted by three experts in designing is used to develop the packaging model and to evaluate the consumers’ satisfaction towards the packaging.
"The packaging with the components of banana leaf lines and bananas can be the model of processed banana packaging when it is considered on the aspects of product quality protection and maintenance, usability, beauty, and promotion."
"Therefore, the packaging should reflect simply about products and be unique to its products."
