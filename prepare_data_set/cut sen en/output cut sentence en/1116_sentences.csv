This research article aims to study the number of scoops affecting the seed sowing rate for semi-automatic paddy field sowing machine.
"The number of scoops to be tested were 3, 5 and 8 scoops, respectively."
"The engine speeds used in the test were 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 2500 rpm respectively."
The rice seed scoop has a length of 65 mm.
Length of scoop area 25 mm and width 4 mm.
Install the equipment to the semi-automatic paddy field sowing machine with dimensions of 1500 mm x 1200 mm x 1000 mm attached to a tractor 24 Hp.
Data was collected for 5 hours with a 10 liters fuel tank for diesel oil.
The distance between each consecutive rice drop was 25 cm x 25 cm.
At the engine speed of 1500 rpm the distance of rice seeding was 25 cm x 25 cm.
"It was found that 3, 5 and 8 scoops of rice seed scoops were used lowest average rice seed consumption rates 5.2, 6.3 and 7.6 kg/rai, respectively."
