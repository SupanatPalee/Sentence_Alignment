"This article aimed to analyze the factors and the importance weight of the factors for truck driversâ€™ skills development in the Eastern Special Development Zone (ESDZ) by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) evaluated by government agencies, experts, and transport operators involved in 10 locations in the ESDZ."
"The implementation process consisted of six main steps: 1) literature review and related theories, 2) selection of factors based on skills, 3) comparison of factor importance, 4) analytical hierarchy process, 5) prioritization of factors, and 6) conclusions and suggestions."
The results showed that the factors used to develop the truck driver skills in the ESDZ consisted of 15 sub-factors.
"They could be divided into 3 main groups (5 sub-factors in each group): 1) basic skills, 2) core skills, and 3) auxiliary skills, with the importance weight of factors of 45.6%, 33.2% and 21.2%, respectively."
"Therefore, government agencies and private sectors can use the factors obtained in planning training courses to develop the skills of truck drivers to be able to support the logistics system in ESDZ effectively."
