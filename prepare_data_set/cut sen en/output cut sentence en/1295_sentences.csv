Masonry infilled in reinforced concrete frames affects the behavior of structures subjected to lateral loading.
"However, there are few researches about compressive behavior of masonry panel in Thailand."
The objective of this study is testing the masonry panels subjected to compressive loading.
The panels are about 760x760 mm2 in width and height.
"They are constructed with clay bricks, 65x160x40 mm3 for dimensions, usually used in construction industrial."
"The compressive loading directions incline to the bed joint varied 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 degrees."
The test results indicated that the inclined angle between loading direction and bed joint significantly affects the strength and failure characteristic.
The failure criterion and stress-strain relationship of the masonry panel subjected to compressive loading are proposed based on the tested data.
