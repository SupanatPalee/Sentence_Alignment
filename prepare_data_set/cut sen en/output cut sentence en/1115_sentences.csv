This study aimed to develop a carbon dioxide adsorbent from biomass residue.
Eucalyptus wood residue of 20 grams was sonically activated in 160 ml of a phosphoric acid solution of 3 and 6 molar for 45 minutes.
Then the activated samples were carbonized at 450Â°C for 1 hr in inert atmosphere.
"It was found that activated carbon prepared at immersion in 3 molar of phosphoric acid solution had a high specific surface area of 1,330.43 m2/g with mostly mesopores."
"Therefore, this activated carbon was selected to develop as an adsorbent by doping monoethanolamide at a concentration of 10-50% by weight."
"Effect of using two doping methods; hot-plate heating and shaking-ultrasonic, were compared on the adsorbent properties."
"Results showed that the specific surface area, pore size and total pore volume of these doped-adsorbent decreased with the concentration of the dopant."
Using shaking-ultrasonic technique gave less reduction of these properties than that of heating technique.
The adsorbent with the greatest ability to adsorb carbon dioxide gas of 59.67 mmol/g was prepared from doping 10 percent by weight of monoethanolamine by shaking-ultrasonic method.
