This research aims to study the chloride penetration resistance and compressive strength of concrete containing fly ash (FA).
"The fly ash was used as a partially replacement material of binder in the form of wet fly ash (WFA) and dry fly ash (DFA) at the percentage replacement of 20%, 40% and 60%."
The water to binder ratio (w/b) was kept at the ratios of 0.50 and 0.60.
"To produce the WFA, FA was mixed with the water at the water to FA ratio (w/f) of 0.60, then cured for 30 days before used in the mixing of concrete."
"The rapid chloride penetration resistance, bulk chloride diffusion resistance and compressive strength of the concrete with WFA and DFA were conducted."
"From the experimental results, it was found that chloride penetration resistance of concrete containing WFA and DFA with the percentage replacement of 40% was the highest."
The chloride penetration resistance of concrete with WFA was higher than that with DFA.
The compressive strength of concrete containing WFA and DFA with the percentage replacement of 20% was higher than cement-only concrete.
The compressive strength of concrete with WFA was higher than that with DFA.
