Removal of a small amount of carbon monoxide from reformed gas before feeding it to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is crucial to be done in order to prolong the lifetime of PEMFC because carbon monoxide is poisonous to platinum-based anode of PEM fuel cell.
The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of catalytic activities of CuO/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by sol gel and single-step sol gel methods get rid of the carbon monoxide when there is too much nitrogen by means of burning carbon monoxide.
"The impact of the preparation of the catalytic activities on the structure, the ability to catalyze activities and the catalyst formed by sol gel, single-step sol gel was used to analyze the certain characteristics, that is, the structure and average crystalline size by X-ray diffraction technique and specific surface areas by nitrogen-adsorption desorption technique."
"The test results of the ability of catalytic activities indicated that, under the condition where there is no hydrogen, both catalysts performed the similar activity to carbon monoxide oxidation reaction."
"Under the presence of 50% H2 in the gas stream, the catalyst prepared by sol gel performed the higher catalytic activity to the reaction than that prepared by single-step sol gel method."
carbon monoxide was completely converted to carbon dioxide at 180°C with selectivity of 65.0.
The presence of CO2 and H2O was also studied.
Both have a negative effect to the reaction.
