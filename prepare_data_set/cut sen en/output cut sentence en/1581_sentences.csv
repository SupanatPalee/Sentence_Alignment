This paper presents an experiment to measure the internal resistance of a multimeter in the Tinkercad program.
"This multimeter has three operating modes: ohmmeter mode, ammeter mode and voltmeter mode."
The experiment is designed using a DC voltage source in ohmmeter mode as the input signal to the resistance to be measured.
The relationship of the variables in a circuit is arranged in the form of a linear equation.
The resistance analysis of the multimeter in each mode can be determined from the slope of the curve.
"The results showed that the ohmmeter mode and the ammeter mode have internal resistances of 100±1 mW and 100±33 mW, respectively, which are very low values."
The voltmeter mode has an internal resistance of 100±1 MW which is very high resistance.
It is also found that the ohmmeter mode has the 1.00±0.01 V DC voltage source.
The properties of the resulting curves have good linearity.
"These experiments are suitable for applying to the experimental kit of students in the fields of electrical-electronics, physics and measurement technology."
