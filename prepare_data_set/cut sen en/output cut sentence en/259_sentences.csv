The objective of this research is to study the fabrication of micro-lubricant pores on high-speed steel by using a laser texturing process.
Effects of laser power and focal position on size of micro-lubricant pores were investigated.
Specimens were made of JIS SKH51 high-speed steel with a hardness of 63 ± 2 HRC and polished smooth surface.
This steel grade is one of the materials utilized for making tools and die.
A laser surface texturing process with fiber laser source using an optical fiber as the active gain medium was employed.
"Studying influence of laser power demonstrated the diameter of micro-lubricant pores and the heat-affected zone diameter increased when the laser power increased, the laser power of 18 watts gave larger diameter of 41 µm."
"For the focal position, the heat-affected zone diameter became larger with raising the focal position."
Elevating the focal position far from the surface resulted in larger diameter of micro-lubricant pores.
At the focal position of 1 mm.
"and laser power of 18 watts exhibited the largest diameter of micro-lubricant pores, 67 µm."
The laser texturing process can be utilized for the fabrication of the micro-lubricant pores with a diameter between 30 to 67 µm.
and this process is able to texture array of dimples over the area of flat surface.
