"Key factors for establishing a competitive advantage within supply chain management used in the frozen food export industry include the Information Infrastructure, Strategic Information System and Information Quality."
This quantitative research studied the causal factors of information strategy in the supply chain management of the frozen food export industry when applied to industrial operations and establishing a competitive advantage.
The 235 samples were collected by questionnaires from 717 members of the public using stratified sampling.
"The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and the causal model was verified according to goodness of fit indexes The results were as follows: The causal model was developed according to the empirical data (c2 = 70.220,d.f."
"=55, c2/d.f."
"= 1.277, p-value = 0.081, Goodness of Fit Index = 0.956, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index = 0.927, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.048, Comparative Fit Index = 0.992, HOELTER = 227.000, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.989)."
The most influential factor affecting the supply chain management performance (SCP) was the strategic information system (SIS) with a 0.549 total effect.
"Meanwhile, the total effect of information system quality (ISQ) to the supply chain management performance (SCP) was 0.192, and the total effect of information technology infrastructure (ITF) to the supply chain management performance (SCP) was 0.192."
"Furthermore, the most influential factor affecting the strategic information system (SIS) was the information technology infrastructure (ITF) with a 0.305 total effect, whilst the total effect of information system quality (ISQ) was 0.192."
