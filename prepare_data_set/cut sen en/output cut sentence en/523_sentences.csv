The aim of this study is to design the hydrogen sulfide removal unit for swine farm using both ferric chloride and sodium hydroxide impregnated baked clay ball 13 mm of diameter.
The baked clay ball was a common adsorbent used in filter media containing in packed column 4inch of diameter and leaving about 10 cm of space above.
"Biogas was derived from swine farm before passing through the packed column 1,790 ppm of hydrogen sulfide, 5 ลิตร/นาทีin of biogas flow rate."
"The condition of hydrogen sulfide removal unit were investigated using completely randomized design (CRD) for the effect of packed column 50, 75 and 100 cm of length."
"It was found that the amount of outlet hydrogen sulfide concentration in the first day after passing the packed column 50, 75 and 100 cm of length were reduced hydrogen sulfide in biogas 27.6, 20.3 and 9.5 ppm, respectively."
"Efficiency were increased 98.46%, 98.87% and 99.47%, respectively."
Efficiency for adsorption of hydrogen sulfide from biogas It can be increased by column pack length
