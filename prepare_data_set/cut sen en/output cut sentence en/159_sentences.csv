"The objectives of this research were 1) to study and monitor characteristics of urban heat island, 2) to study relationship between characteristics of urban heat island and land cover and 3) to study relationship between characteristics of urban heat and number and density of population in Pathumthani province during 1990 â€“ 2020 using multi- temporal satellite imageries from Landsat-5 and Landsat-8, thermal infrared, and operation land imagers which were divided into 2 seasons as summer and winter, in order to study normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI)."
Relationship between characteristics of urban heat island and land cover was measured including number and density of population using a simple linear regression equation.
"According to the study and monitoring, it was found that Pathumthani had higher temperature than neighboring provinces with less urbanization like Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya and Chachoengsao, but had lower temperature than more urbanized area like Bangkok."
"Its temperature ranged from 18-40 degrees Celsius, average temperature was 30.16 degrees Celsius, the highest temperature was 40 degrees Celsius and the lowest temperature was 18 degrees Celsius."
"The study and monitoring result characteristics of urban heat island was consistent with the study and analysis of average dry-bulb temperature, average relative humidity, and average monthly rainfall."
"The study results from the relationship between characteristics of urban heat island and land cover, and number and density of population found that the relationship between land surface temperature and land cover, based on NDVI and NDBI, was very high in summer and winter, R-squared (R2) values were 0.9919, 0.9884, 0.9422 and 0.9773 respectively."
The study results of the relationship between characteristics of urban heat island and number and density of population found the relationship was low but positively correlated.
It was found that R-squared (R2) value of the number of populations was 0.3080 and R-squared (R2) value of the density of population was 0.3918.
