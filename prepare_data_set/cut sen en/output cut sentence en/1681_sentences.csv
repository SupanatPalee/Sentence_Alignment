This research objective aimed to study the factors related to the digital agricultural technology knowledge of young smart farmers (YSF).
"The sample group was 169 young smart farmers in the central region, collecting data in the year 2020 before the COVID-19 situation, by using a questionnaire to collect data from the field for: 1) the digital agricultural technology knowledge level 2) The relationship between personal factors and the knowledge of digital agricultural technology."
"The collected data were analyzed using frequency, percentage, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and mean statistics and the correlation was determined by using chi-square statistics."
"The results of the study revealed that the typical YSF was male, and the range of age was 41–55 years old."
"YSF graduated with a bachelor's degree, 43.79%."
18.34% of YSF lived in Singburi province.
"The range of income of 100,001–250,000 baht per month (30.77%)."
"Furthermore, knowledge of digital agricultural technology was limited."
"When considering each aspect of knowledge, it was found that most YSF had at a moderate level of solar energy Knowledge (mean 2.67±1.03) was at a moderate level."
"Geographic information systems (mean 2.52±1.05), Global Positioning System (GPS) (mean 2.14±1.08), Drone for Agriculture (mean 2.07±1.00) and Internet of Things for Smart Agricultural (mean 1.94±1.05) were shown at a low level."
"From the results of the study, finding on the relationship between personal factors and the Digital agricultural technology knowledge, it was found that gender, age, education level, and income were statistically correlated with knowledge (p<0.01)."
"From the results of the study, the top three for YSF to improve their additional knowledge, they need namely solar energy, Internet of Things (IoT) innovations for smart agriculture, and agricultural machinery."
"There is a need to reduce costs, reduce labor, and increase productivity, respectively."
