This paper proposes load evaluation of three-phase induction motor in case of balanced and unbalanced voltage supplies.
The voltage unbalance is based on IEEE 114 - 2010 standard.
"Four load calculation methods; Input Power Method (IPM), Current Method (CM), Slip Speed Method (SSM), and Power Factor Method (PFM) are investigated with and without a voltage correcting factor."
The calculated results are compared with the experimental results.
It is found to be useful for motor load estimation in all cases of voltage source conditions.
