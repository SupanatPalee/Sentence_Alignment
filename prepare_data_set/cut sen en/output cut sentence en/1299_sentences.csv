This research was creation of friction joint prototype to develop a model of aging.
The design from elderly body change data in muscle decreases with age and uses the principle of friction.
"With trial participants adult aging 30-34 years, 4 peoples and elderly aging 59-64 years, 5 peoples."
Ergometer test compares the ratio between steady heart rate with maximum heart rate.
During participants elderly with participants adult not wear and wear friction joint prototype.
"The result, ergometer test of participants elderly have a ratio of steady heart rate with maximum heart rate is significantly different with ergometer test of participants adult not wear friction joint prototype and ergometer test of participants elderly have a ratio of steady heart rate with maximum heart rate is no significantly different with ergometer test of participants adult wear friction joint prototype."
The wearing of friction joint prototype in adult similar to the elderly more than not wearing.
Because wearing friction joint prototype increases a burden on the body.
"Make more tired, Uncomfortable movement, the body uses more energy, Static muscle strength decreases with age."
Can simulate the elderly.
