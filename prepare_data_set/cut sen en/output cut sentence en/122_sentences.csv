"This research aimed to investigate the effect of the amount of magnesium on graphite shape and mechanical property of ductile cast iron, the rest of chemical components in iron were 3.0-4.0% carbon and  1.8-2.9% silicon, by the induction furnace in term of 0.30% weight inoculation while three different levels of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% weight of FeSiMg 4.5-5.1% were used in the sandwich process-furnace at 1450°C."
The microstructure was examined for the graphite shape and the mechanical property was investigated.
"It was found that the 1.0% weight of FeSiMg 4.5-5.1% provided the circular graphite shape which was the optimal mechanical property of the ultimate tensile strength at 782 MPa, yield strength at 578 MPa, elongation at 16% and hardness at 85 HB."
