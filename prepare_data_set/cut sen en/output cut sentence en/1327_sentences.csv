This paper aims to weld a dissimilar SS400/SUS304 steel T-joint using high chromium electrode and study an effect of welding current on joint properties.
T-joints that welded by the designed welding currents were mechanically prepared and systematically investigated for joint properties.
The experimental results were summarized as follows.
Dissimilar SS400/SUS304 steels T-joint could successfully welded using a gas metal arc welding process with no defect in weld metal.
The optimized welding current in this experiment was 160 A that showed a minimized crack in a bending test of 0.247 mm.
"A different chemical composition of low carbon steel and high chromium weld metal produced a small interface that showed a smaller mixed zone of reinforced elements and base metal, and also affected to decrease the joint strength."
"However, the increase of the welding current could increase the combination of the reinforced element and the base metal at the interface and affected to increase the joint strength."
