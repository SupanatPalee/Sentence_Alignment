"This research explored the iron ore deposit found in Uttaradit province such as Nampee, Baan Kao Lek and Baan Pang Woon."
"The chemical analysis showed that the percentage of iron in the iron ores from Nampee, Baan Kao Lek and Baan Pang Woon were 68.40, 67.01 and 57.24 respectively."
All of the iron ores found were in form of Hematite.
"In this study, the iron ores were processed, smelted by a smelter with the combination of ancient and modern skills."
"The smelted irons were forged into bars with quantities of 1,300 grams of Nampee iron, 773 grams of Baan Kao Lek iron and 873 grams of Baan Pang Woon iron."
The chemical analysis after smelting showed that Nampee iron consisted of 0.675%Cu and 3.19%W.
Baan Pang Woon iron consisted of 1.8%C and 0.130%Mn.
Baan Kao Lek iron consisted of 96.47%Fe.
The iron ore from these deposits could be forged with comparable qualities with the modem steel.
