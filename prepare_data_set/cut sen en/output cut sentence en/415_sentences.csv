The objective of this research was to study the effects of beverage can body addition on the  phase modification in recycled Al-Si-Fe cast alloys.
"Beverage can body parts with different proportions (5, 10, 20 and 30 wt.%) were added into the molted Al-Si-Fe alloy for 30 minutes holding time, then poured into a stainless steel mold at 0.2 °C/s cooling rate."
"The result on the beverage can body microstructure was found to consist of Al6(Mn,Fe) and Mg2Si phases."
The microstructure of the Al-Si-Fe cast alloy indicates that the  phase that distributes in the -Al matrix.
"After the addition of 5 wt.% of the beverage can body, the size and length of the  phase decreases."
"The addition of 10, 20 and 30 wt.% of beverage can body showed transformation from the  phase to the  phase."
"In particular, the addition of 30 wt.% of the beverage can body which led to the most efficient of modification of the  phase."
The quantitative analysis of the phases showed that the  phase decreased by 50-80 % depending on amount the beverage can body addition.
