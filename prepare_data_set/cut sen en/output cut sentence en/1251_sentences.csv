The objective of this research was to study the properties of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) mixed with calcium carbonate and fly ash.
"Portland cements type 1 was replaced by calcium carbonate at ratios of 5%, 10% and 20% by weight and fly ash at ratios of 20%, 30%, and 50% respectively."
The total powder material content was 550 kg/m3 and water to powder ratio was kept constant at 0.28 for all mixtures.
"Properties of SCC including, workability, compressive strength and drying shrinkage were tested."
The results indicated that SCC workability was increased by increasing fly ash content.
"At the same time, compressive strength was decreased by increasing calcium carbonate content."
SCC mixtures mixed with a ternary blend of powder materials (FA20CC5) had compressive strength as high as 75.28 MPa at 120 days.
