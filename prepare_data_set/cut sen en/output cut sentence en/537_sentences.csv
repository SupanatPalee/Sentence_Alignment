Thailand suffers from floods frequently but the data of the river bank dam is still incomplete for public use resulting in some parts of water management are not effective.
"Then, the collecting and studying of river bank dam are necessary in developing the data base for public use."
"This study has two parts: (1) collecting river bank dam types designed by the Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning (DPT), both centrally and regionally, and classifying the dam types, and (2) collecting data of existing river bank dam projects of DPT in Ayutthaya province and creating a database readily to use."
The study results could be summarized as the followings.
(1) Total 51 types of DPT river bank dam were collected.
"By taking physical characteristics and engineering structures into consideration, they could be divided into two groups: horizontal and vertical river bank dams."
"Furthermore, the horizontal group can be classified and code-named into 9 formats with 17 types and the vertical group can also be classified and code-named into 11 formats with 34 types."
(2) Information from all 58 DPT river bank dam projects in Ayutthaya Province was collected.
"The obtained information is project location, latitude, longitude, dam length, pile depth, construction beginning year finishing year, and the river bank dam type that has been code-named earlier."
This completed data base allows agencies related to water management or any people to acquire the information easily and effectively.
