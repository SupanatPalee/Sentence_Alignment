This research aims to analyze the alternatives of using different internal light bulb system in a construction site office over a long construction period.
The case study under investigated was the consultant office building for the MRT BLUE LINE extension project for the Hua Lamphong - Bang Khae and Bang Sue - Tha Phra sections.
"The research method is Cost Effectiveness Analysis to identify the incoming of project and apply the Net Present Value (NPV), Playback Period analysis and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to compare between alternatives of changing the lighting system to new LED technology lamps from the current T8 light bulbs."
"The analysis covers three building areas: the central, office and external space of the site office building."
"The research found that the proposed alternative of changing to LED bulb has a payback period of 2.47 years in the office area, 1.39 years in the common area and 1.59 years in the external area."
"The return on investment based on an eight-year analysis include the discount rate vale (6.99%) is 60,822.48 baht and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 35.99%."
"As a result, it is feasible to invest in the new alternative of LED technology lamps for this siteâ€™s office building."
"In addition, this alternative complies with the government policy of energy conservation."
