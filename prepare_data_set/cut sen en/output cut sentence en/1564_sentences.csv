This research aims to study the possibility of using waste plaster gypsum mold from the ceramic industry in Lampang Province to produce wall materials.
Waste plaster gypsum mold was ground and sieved to keep similar particle size distribution to those of sand.
"The ground plaster gypsum was then replaced with sand in the mortar at 10, 30, 50, 60, 80, 90, and 100 percent by volume."
"The effect of waste plaster gypsum on physical, mechanical, and thermal properties was carried out."
"The results showed that compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength were decreased with the increasing amount of waste plaster gypsum."
"The compressive strength of mortars with the replacement of waste plaster gypsum at 50 and 100 percent by volume at 28 days was 10.50 and 7.00 Megapascal, respectively."
"However, the thermal conductivity of mortar containing 100 percent waste plaster gypsum was 0.38 Watts perÂ meter per Kelvin, which was reduced by 78 percent compared to that of the control mortar."
It achieved a density approximately at 1.60 gram per cubic centimeter.
"Therefore, waste plaster gypsum as sand replacement material might result in a lightweight wall block with suitable thermal insulation properties."
