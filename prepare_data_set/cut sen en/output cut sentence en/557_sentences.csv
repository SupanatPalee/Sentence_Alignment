"This research investigates the conversion yield of natural rubber product such as raw rubber sheets, cup lumps, and Para rubber latex to bio-crude oil by hydrothermal liquefaction process."
The reaction temperatures are in the ranges of 350 °C and 375 °C.
"The materials are dissolved in water at H2O/NR mass ratios of 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1."
The reaction time was 60 minutes.
"Results show that the highest yields of bio-crude oil is 71.40% by using raw rubber sheets as raw material, while the bio-crude oil yield from using cup lumps, and Para rubber latex are 70.03% and 22.47% respectively."
"The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) analysis shows peak absorbance at 2,920 cm–1, indicating the intensity of the absorbance of the alkane functional group (C-H) which indicates fuel oil property."
This study shows the technical possibility of producing bio-crude oil from natural rubber in Thailand by-using the hydrothermal liquefaction process.
This might be the alternative energy in the future and support the beneficial of using Para rubber as well.
