This research aimed to improve the efficiency of the ancient umbrella production process in order to responds and support customer’s demands and to increase the productivity of the company.
Applying the principles of motion and time study was analyzed by using flow process chart.
It was found that there was a problem in the process of drilling the holes for the ancient umbrella supports.
It is difficult and takes a long time because one hole must be drilled at a time.
"The researcher has improved the work process by applying the ECRS principle, namely combining some redundant working methods (Combine) and improving the working methods (Simplify)."
The design of working tools is an ancient umbrella support hole punching device used in the production process.
Then conduct an experiment to determine the optimum condition of the device.
"An experiment of 4 types of drill arrangement characteristics, namely straight line, oblique line, V-shaped (V) and inverted V-shaped (Λ), was performed using a Complete Randomized Design (CRD)."
It was found that the arrangement of drill bits had a significant effect on the drilling speed of ancient umbrella supports.
(P-Value=0.00) at 95 percent confidence level.
The arrangement of straight-line drill bits gives the highest drilling speed of 0.84 mm/s.
"After improving the production process, it helps employees work faster."
They can drill a hole 1 time for 8 holes per 1 antique umbrella support.
"The process of drilling the umbrella pole from the original 13 steps reduced to 5 steps and increase the efficiency of producing 1 antique umbrella from the original production time of 75.09 minutes to 38.73 minutes, representing a 48.42 percent increase in efficiency."
