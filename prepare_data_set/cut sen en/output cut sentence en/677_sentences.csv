This research aims to study 1) factors affecting course withdrawals of undergraduate Engineering students at Srinakharinwirot University in academic year 2016 and 2) the ways to reduce the number of course withdrawals of undergraduate Engineering students at Srinakharinwirot University in the future.
"The sample group, used in this research, was composed of 335 undergraduate Engineering students at Srinakharinwirot University from all departments."
"A questionnaire was used as a tool to collect the data, and the data analysis was done by descriptive statistics, t-test and F-test."
This study showed several results as follows.
"First, the most important factor, affecting students’ course withdrawals, is the curriculum/teaching management."
"Second, other important factors are other factors, lecturers, and students, respectively."
"In terms of students, the top factor is that the students concern about their mid-term test scores."
They are not sure whether they will pass the subject after taking the final examination.
"In terms of lecturers, the top factor is that the lecturers do not assess the student's understanding."
"In terms of curriculum/ instructional management, the one-week examination schedule is so dense that the students cannot take time to prepare themselves for all subjects."
"Three top factors among other factors are 1) concern about lowering GPAX, 2) retirement and 3) no offered course during summer school."
"Third, the students, who study in different fields, have different factors that affect the course withdrawals by overall factors (Sig."
"= .000), by student factor and by curriculum/instructional management factor (Sig."
"= .000), by lecturer factor (Sig."
"= .009), and by other factors (Sig."
= .021).
"Forth, the students, who study in different years, have no significant difference in the factors affecting the course withdrawals."
