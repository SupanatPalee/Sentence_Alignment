This research focuses on the effect of condensation set temperature on lard pyrolysis.
The experimental conditions were a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C for 3 hours and a second condensing unit temperature of -10 °C.
"It adjusted the temperature of the first five-stage condenser to 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C to study the quantity and properties of the fuel."
The results showed that the condensate temperature was 60 °C.
"The maximum amount of heavy fuel was 41 wt%, while the condensing unit temperature was 80 °C and the maximum amount of light fuel was 4 wt%."
"Different heavy fuel oils have a density of 927 kg/m3, a viscosity of 8.69 cSt, and a high calorific value of 39 MJ/kg."
"And it ignites at a temperature of 31.37 °C, while a light fuel has a density of 686.67 kg/m3, a viscosity of 1.67 cSt, and a calorific value of 40 MJ/kg."
The chemical composition analysis found that heavy fuel oil has a chemical composition with acidic substances as the main component.
While light fuels have the chemical composition of substances in the gasoline group as the main constituents
