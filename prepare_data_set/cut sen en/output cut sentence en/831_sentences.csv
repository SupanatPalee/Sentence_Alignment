The purposes of the study were to investigate and analyze factors affecting to Napier mowing by using the design of experiments.
The factors were the movement speed (kilometer/hour) and the speed of cutting head (round/minute) which affected the length of the grass.
The experiment examined with 45 days and 60 days Napier through designing with full factorial design.
"After that, the grasses were cut by adjusting order."
The data of the experiment were analyzed through the statistical analysis programs.
The results had shown that the movement speed and the speed of cutting head of Napier mowing affected the length of the grass significantly at 0.05.
"Moreover, when cutting 45 days and 60 days old grass by the 50 horsepower tractor which the movement speed 5 kilometers/hour, and the speed of cutting head was 1,800 round/minute in an hour, the machine could cut the grass averagely at 6.84 tons with 3-5 centimeters long of grass."
This paper presents to a development process of a movable warehouse racking system.
"The structure of movable warehouse racking system composes of 1) two-nonmovable rack units, and 2) two-movable rack units."
Each movable rack unit is designed to support 50 kg of capacity per unit and is driven by a ball-screw with a 24VDC servo motor as an actuator.
"For the control system of automated storage system, a computer is used to be a main hardware controller, a program is developed for controlling the system via LabVIEW, and CAN bus is chosen to communicate between computer and motor drive."
"The experiments show that the developed system can work well and the movable rack unit consumes the maximum electric current about 5.31 A at 0.167 m/s of its speed, which effects to the goods package to slip about 0.004 m."
