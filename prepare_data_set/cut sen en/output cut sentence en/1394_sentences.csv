A numerical work has been conducted to examine turbulent flow and heat transfer characteristics in a three-dimensional channel with modified V-baffles placed on the lower wall.
The heat flux condition is applied only to the lower wall while the upper wall is insulated.
"The computations are based on the finite volume method with the Coupled algorithm for the airflow rate in terms of Reynolds numbers ranging from 4,000 to 20,000."
The computation reveals that pairs of counter-rotating vortices created by the modified V-baffle induce impingement/attachment flows on the walls leading to greater increase in heat transfer over the heated wall.
"The maximum value of the thermal enhancement factor, h is found to be 2.25 at BRf=0.04, BRb=0.20 and Re=4000."
