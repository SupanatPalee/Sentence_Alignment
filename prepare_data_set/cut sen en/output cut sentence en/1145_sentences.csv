This research aimed to reduce workload while accurately collecting data for layer hens farm management and control environment in the layer hens farm to be suitable for open housing system in every Thailandâ€™s weather season.
The researcher team conducted the research project by separating the system into two parts.
"The first part was for layer hens farm management which comprised of laying and removed hens with scanning QR codes located at each cage in order to collect data with high accuracy compared to the original system which used paper-based data collection, and function for recording revenues and expenses during raising layer hens for analyzing efficiency of raising layer hens."
Operations on the layer hens farm management application could be done by one smartphone with Android operating system and hence the farm owner had no need to procure an equipment that would work as a server for data collection.
"To provide access to the system developed from everywhere, the researcher team prepared a server for storing layer hens farm data in a database format for an application user to store operational data in the server."
This made possible to analyze efficiency of farm management from everywhere and this data could be used to compare to past layer hens farm operations.
"The other part of this research was a hardware for interior environment control which used a Fuzzy logic system as a tool to accurately analyze temperature outside/inside the layer house, humidity outside/inside the layer house, and illuminance outside/inside the house so as to precisely control ventilators, pump for water sprayers on the roof house, and lighting system for laying in every weather season in Thailand."
Data transmission and reporting about environment in the house and controlling operations between the environment control hardware and mobile application on a smartphone was through Bluetooth or IoT system.
"From trialing both parts of the research at an agricultural farm raising 500 layer hens, time for data collection of laying was reduced by about 5 times compared to the original system which collected laying data in a paper form in case laying was from more than 60% of total number of layer hens, and by about 2 times in case laying was from less than 60% of total number of layer hens."
"For farm management, the application could search and summarize data as needed for analysis, whereas for the original management, it required to look into documents and collect data for analysis."
"Regarding to the environment control with the Fuzzy logic system, it could adjust environment in the layer hens house to have suitable temperature, humidity and illuminance for raising layer hens."
