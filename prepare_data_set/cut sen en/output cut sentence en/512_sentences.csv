This paper presents the reduction of peak demand during on peak period by replacing the energy during off peak period with battery energy storage system (BESS).
Then this period was reference from time of use rate (TOU) of Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) or Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) of Thailand.
The research has proposed a model of Grid-connected of Medium General Service with BESS to design to algorithm for finding the discharge time periods (FDTP).
The Algorithm has to the results from forecasting with trend line estimation to predict optimal of load profile and discharged time.
This research will be forecast and analyze the results of 15 days from 20 days of data.
The results of case study showed that the value average from the power trend line estimation could reduced the peak demand and consumption the most are 34.94% and 40.62% and the linear trend is worst estimation will be reduced the peak demand and consumption are 30.50% and 39.48%.
