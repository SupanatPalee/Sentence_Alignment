This paper presents the development of special laboratory in the course of electrical network analysis which students can design the circuits and develop them for practical prototype.
The procedure consists of three steps as 1) To study and understand the problem and find the solution using equipment or electronic circuit.
2) To design and simulate by software for electrical analysis such as LTspice and OrCAD.
3) To design the printed circuit board for practical prototype.
"The objective of this development is that can help the students to design, create and make the practical prototype by using the outcome-based learning and KAPIS evaluation."
