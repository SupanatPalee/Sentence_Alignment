"This paper presents an implementation of a low-cost real-time people counting system on raspberry pi based on applied Tiny YOLO V3, the latest object detection algorithm with high speed and accuracy."
The architecture of the Tiny YOLO v3 is much less complicated than the complete YOLO architecture.
"Thus, it is suitable for the Raspberry Pi embedded system platform that has limited resources and processing speed."
The experimental results show the performance of the speed and accuracy of the proposed system.
