This research aimed to study the tolerance effect of the natural frequencies of the HDD actuator arm to reduce the working time of the CNC machine in HDD manufacturing.
"In the study, the HDD actuator arm was simulated with a three-dimensional model in the finite element software."
The HDD actuator arm dimensions were varied within the tolerance criteria of the HDD manufacturer.
The natural frequencies of the HDD actuator arm were evaluated by using the finite element software.
"The results demonstrated that the tolerance of Heat sink thickness, Hub diameter, Swage pad diameter, and Arm slot 1 diameter had a natural frequency variation less than 50 Hz."
"Therefore, the working time for those positions production by CNC machine to obtain a high precision can be reduced due to the tolerance of that positions are not significant in the natural frequencies of the HDD actuator."
