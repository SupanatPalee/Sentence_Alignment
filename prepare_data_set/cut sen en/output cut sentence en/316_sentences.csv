The objective of this study was to explore the potential growth inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani) using caffeine from Arabica coffee pulp with respect to different concentrations of caffeine.
"R. solani commonly causes seed rot, damping-off, sheath blight, and leaf blight."
"In this study, R. solani was cultured in the laboratory scale using Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates in the presence of caffeine concentrations of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/L for 10 days at room temperature."
"The results showed that caffeine from Arabica coffee pulp gave significant difference in the growth inhibition rate of R. solani, as compared to the control condition (P<0.01)."
"Caffeine from Arabica coffee pulp at the concentrations of 20 and 40 mg/L gave the average growth inhibition rates of R. solani of 15.3±4.2% and 58.8±3.5%, respectively."
"Besides, the concentrations of 60 and 80 mg/L resulted in the average growth inhibition rate of R. solani of 100.0±0.0% for both conditions, as no growth of R. solani could be found on the PDA plates."
These results could be explained by the allelopathic potential of caffeine on inhibiting the growth of plant pathogenic fungi.
"This study provided a development of efficient method for growth inhibition of R. solani in which focused on the use of natural substances, as the caffeine content in Arabica coffee pulp was used."
This Arabica coffee pulp was considered as an agricultural waste.
