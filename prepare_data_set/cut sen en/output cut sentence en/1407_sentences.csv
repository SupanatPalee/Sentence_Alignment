This article presents a study of location errors of the GPS tracking system when objects are in motion.
The hypothesis is the installation of a GPS positioning device in the car.
"When the car is in motion, the GPS system will show the position of the car moving along the distance."
The position value is compared with the GPS that is processed in conjunction with the speed and direction of the vehicle's movement.
"The test results show that the position value provided by the GPS system while the vehicle is in motion is subject to an error, depending on the vehicle speed."
