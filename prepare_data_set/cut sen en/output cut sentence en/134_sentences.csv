"The purpose of this research was to study the effect of temperature on the change in moisture ratio of Turmeric under drying conditions at 50, 60 and 70 °C."
and a hot air speed of 1.5 m/s.
"Drying was performed from the initial moisture content of 1,060.61 ± 1.45 percent dry basis until the remaining moisture was 136.40 ± 2.35  percent dry basis."
"Then, the change in moisture ratio during drying was studied with a mathematical model of Lewis, Henderson and Pabis, Page, Modified Page I, Logistic, Logarithmic, Two term and Midilli et al."
found that the Logarithmic model best predicted the moisture ratio change characteristics of Turmeric.
"It has the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and chi-square () , root mean square error (RMSE) and the lowest mean biased error (MBE)."
The effective moisture diffusivity coefficient of Turmeric drying was between 5.58 x 10-8 - 2.39 x 10-7 square meters per second.
"From the CIE (L*-a*-b*) color quality change analysis of Turmeric, it was found that the color parameters L* (brightness), a* (red/green value) and b* (yellow, blue value) were used to estimate the color change during drying."
"The L*, a* and b* values of dehydrated Turmeric were decreased when the drying temperature is higher while the total color difference (TCD) was 20.032, 18.231 and 15.476 at the temperature of 50, 60 and 70 °C."
