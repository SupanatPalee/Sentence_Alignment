"The objective of this research is to study the relationship between countries in Southeast Asia (ASEAN), the total confirmed cases of COVID-19, the reproduction rate, the stringency index, and the new deaths attributed to COVID-19."
Another purpose of this research is to find a suitable statistical model to study the incidence rate of deaths among people infected with COVID-19 in Southeast Asian countries (ASEAN).
"The online secondary data is used in this study, and the models considered are the Poisson regression model and the negative-binomial regression model."
The results show that the Poisson regression model is unsuitable for the data used in this study because the variance of this data is significantly higher than its mean; this is called the overdispersion problem.
"On the other hand, the negative-binomial regression model is the most suitable model for studying the incidence rate of deaths among people infected with COVID-19 in Southeast Asian countries."
"Moreover, Thailand has been found to have a higher incidence rate of death from COVID-19 than other Southeast Asian countries; the incidence rate of death from COVID-19 in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam is lower than in Thailand by 99.5%, 99.4%, 28.1%, 99.4%, 72.0%, 99.7%, 56.0%, 97.9%, and 45.4%, respectively."
"The purpose of this research was to compare the performance of the three control chart types: The Hybrid Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Control Chart (HEWMA), Triple Homogeneously Weighted Average Control Chart (THWMA) and Double Exponential Weighted Average Control Chart (DMEWMA) by detecting shift in size of the shape parameter of the process in which the data has a 3-parameter gamma distribution.simulating the data studied by the Monte Carlo Method in which each situation was repeated 10,000 cycles by specifying the shape parameter, scale parameter,location parameter amd the smoothing parameters of the HEWMA control chart were set to 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 THWMA control chartis 0.03, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and DMEWMA control chart is 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.2, 0.5."
"Process variation shift size () is 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.5, 2 and 2.5."
"The criteria for the control chart's performance is determined by its average run length (ARL), where the most efficient control chart gave the least average run length when the process was out of control."
THWMA control charts the best monitor shift of parameter and as the size increases the THWMA control chart performs similarly to the DMEWMA1 and DMEWMA2 control charts if the shift is large.
The HEWMA control chart will give you the best performance.
"This research aimed to compare the performance of the one-way analysis of variance (F test), Welch's test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Van der Waerden test, and Median test for testing the difference between central values of more than two independent populations using counting data with binomial and Poisson distributions."
The criteria used to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the proposed tests are the ability to control the probability of type I error and power.
"The results showed that for the binomial distribution data, all tests could control the probability of type I error for most situations, except when the sample size of each group was 10, and the variance of each group was less than 4, and when the sample size of each group was 15 and (n, p) were (10, 0.1) and (10, 0.7)."
"For the Poisson distribution data, all tests could also control the probability of type I error in almost situations."
"However, except for the Welch's Test, the Van der Waerden Test, and the Median Test, the probability of type 1 error could not be controlled in cases when the sample size of each group was ten and  = 30."
"When considering the power, it was found that the analysis of variance provided the highest power than other tests in almost situations."
The results of this study will guide data analysts in choosing an appropriate statistic for testing the difference between central values of more than two independent populations when data is count data.

"The form of creating a small number of shots through a few-shot Image Generation via Cross-domain Correspondence, which has the distinction of not requiring the large number of images used in training as a regular GAN and not overfitting with too much accuracy."
"The dataset used in training was the thumbnail of the DOTA2 hero character, with a size of 256x144 pixels, 111 images, and made up of 3 models: 1) the Source_ffhq model (a StyleGAN2 model that learned to create human faces), 2) the Church models (StyleGAN2 models that learned to create church images), and 3) the Horse models (a StyleGAN2 model that learned to create horses)."
Quantitative comparisons showed that models adapted from the FFHQ model could correctly adapt a person's eyes and nose to the character's eyes and nose.
"However, the mouth part was erased, and other models could only create half the image but still correspond to the character traits."
"The images created by the three models were quite dark and fresh, which also looked like the images of a DOTA2 hero."
"In the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric results, images created with a low FID score were as close as the original DOTA2-style images."
"As for qualitative evaluation, it was found that the sample of players have preferred the Source_ffhq model the most, followed by Church models and Horses models, respectively."
The main factors were decided by being familiar with DOTA2.
"Therefore, this research can guide the creation of new character images from the original DOTA2 hero character series, with the opportunity to increase revenue for the game developer company, player satisfaction, and knowledge of further game development using GAN techniques."

Recently biaxially polypropylene (BOPP) film or micro-perforated film was developed to create a modified atmosphere to physically extend the shelf-life of fresh-cut produces.
"However, the size of microhole was 80 micron which is bigger than the size of typical microorganism, thus the biological contamination from the air may occur."
"This research, therefore, aimed to study the possibility of microbial contamination via the hole of micro-perforated film The experiment was conducted by pouring plate count agar in the tray and sealed with micro-perforated films of different pore numbers, 0 holes (BOPP-0H), 5 holes (BOPP-5H) and 80 holes (BOPP-80H)."
The trays were incubated at 25 ºC and 8 ºC (open and close refrigerator) for 10 days.
The number of airborne microorganisms was also examined by settle plate method.
"The result showed that the number of microbes found in the tray related to that of airborne, especially when stored at 25 ºC which had higher contamination of airborne microorganisms than at 8 ºC."
"Therefore, the microbes contaminated in the air could pass through the perforated film of 80-micrometer size."
This was due to the size of the hole bigger than the cell and spore of microorganism.
"In addition, the tray covered with BOPP-80H had higher microbial contamination than that with BOPP-5H."
"Whilst, the tray covered with BOPP-0H had no microbial colony."
"In order to prolong the storage life of the fresh cut produces using micro-perforated film, the packaging must be placed in the atmosphere with low airborne contamination to delay both physical and biological spoilage."

Latent heat of condensation is an energy-releasing reaction when water vapor comes in contact with the surface of an object containing temperature lower than the dew point or saturation temperature of a drying media.
"During the condensation, the thermal energy in the system is suddenly absorbed by the lower temperature object in order to make the phase change."
"Subsequently, the object temperature rapidly increases to the mentioned temperature of the drying media."
"In this research work, the energy-releasing property from condensation was applied to paddy during fluidizing process to prevent the rancidity, caused by hydrolysis process of lipids in rice bran by lipase enzyme into free fatty acid (FFA), of the brown rice during storage."
Paddy with post harvested moisture content of 33.3% dry basis was dried out in varous conditions under humidified hot air (HHA) condition generated of saturated water vapor by electrical boiler.
The hot water vapor was injected into drying systems of fluidized bed dryer to blend with the hot air (HA) which was set in different drying temperature of 100-150oC and 1-30% of relative humidity (RH).
The drying kinetic result revealed that the condensing reaction occurred at the initial stages of drying process when the paddy temperature was lower than the dew point temperature of HHA media.
"During the condensation process carried on, the grain temperature rapidly increased to the higher level than that under the normal drying process with HA."
"Its increase, moreover, was depended on increasing RH of the HA."
The occurrence of condensation resulted in better deceleration of FFA content of the brown rice compared to drying by HA during storage for 6 months (analyzed every month).

The study of sour cream - tuna spread production indicated the problem of metal contamination in final products detected after passing through the metal detector.
Two types of metal were found; metal scrap from steel cans and steel rust.
The objective of the project was to decrease the metal contamination to zero waste (0 %).
The main cause of metal scrap contamination came from the can opener which lacked of sharpness and had loosened blade cover resulting to inefficient cutting in a single round.
Lack of manual for can – opener led to inconsistent usage.
Changing blade and the material in the locking blade to stainless steel and adjusting the lever blade resulted to 0 % for the contaminated scrap metal from cans.
"Preparation of can opening instruction for standard usage could reduce the required number of employees and costs for waste management totally around 153,000 Baht/year."
The rust problem found in the final product was mainly from inappropriate process before mixing the tuna mixture.
Tuna inspection was improved into 2 steps: using the magnetic bars rolled on tuna and passing through the metal detector.
The results showed that stainless steel was not found in the final product after the improvement (zero waste) for the management.
"Cost reduction was equivalent to 13,000 Baht/year."
The improvement also helped increasing the customer reliability and enhanced the production efficiency.
