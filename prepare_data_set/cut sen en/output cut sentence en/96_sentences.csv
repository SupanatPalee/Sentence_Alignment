"In the past, the location routing problems of Para-rubber was not properly studied for solutions."
"As a result, the rubber seller has to cover the transportation cost."
"In this research, a mathematics model is applied to develop an algorithm for solving the problem which aims to reduce transportation cost while considering the economic worth."
"Results show that deploying a total of 10 depots which consists of 3 small-capacity depots, 5 middle-capacity depots and 2 unlimited-capacity depots can reduce the transportation cost from 354,335.22 baht/day down to 203,171 baht/day or 42.7 percentage."
"In conclusion, the mathematics model and cost-saving algorithm are proven to be an attractive solution to the location routing problem."
