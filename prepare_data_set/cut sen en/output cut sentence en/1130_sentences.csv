"In this work, the effect of pressure on fruit-bunch separation and Crude Palm Oil (CPO) yield in palm-bunch sterilization for palm oil milling process."
"Palm bunches were sterilized using direct steaming in a mini sterilizer for 45 min, and the sterilization pressure was varied at 1.5 bar and 3 bar."
"The palm bunches, after sterilizing, was loaded suddenly into the bunch-fruit separator to consider the efficiency of fruit-bunch separation."
"Then, palm fruit were extracted by screw press to evaluate a CPO yield."
"The results show that at 1.5 bar and 3 bar, amount of palm fruits from fruit-bunch separation was 86.83% and 87.28%, respectively, and CPO yield was 53.47% and 53.84%, respectively, which slightly affected with small discrepancy lesser than 1%."
"Therefore, to apply this direct steaming in palm-bunch sterilization process, the sterilization pressure at 1.5 bar should be selected due to lower energy consumption as compared to the case of 3 bar."
