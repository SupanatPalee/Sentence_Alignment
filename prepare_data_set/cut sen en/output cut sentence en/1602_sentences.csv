"This study was to analyze and assess lead, cadmium, copper, zinc and iron contaminations in 55 plots of Chinese kale, broccoli, morning glory, spring onions, lettuce and coriander in Bueng Phra sub-district, Muang district, Phitsanulok province by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer."
"The results showed that economic vegetables had the highest iron contamination with an average value of 474.52±41.47 mg/kg (ranged between 414.67-519.33 mg/kg), followed by zinc, copper, lead and cadmium with the averaged values of 28.41±5.25 mg/kg (ranged between 22.68-36.92 mg/kg), 6.55±2.18 mg/kg (ranged between of 3.53-10.38 mg/kg), 8.29±4.50 mg/kg (ranged between 0.68-11.96 mg/kg) and 1.01±0.26 mg/kg (ranged between 0.67-1.48 mg/kg), respectively."
"The concentrations of lead and zinc in Chinese kale and coriander exceeded the acceptable levels as prescribed in the standard with 50% and 100% of the total samples, respectively."
Iron concentration in all vegetables exceeded the standard of Nation food institute B.C.2554.
