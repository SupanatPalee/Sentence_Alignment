The objective of this research is to apply mathematical model for selecting delivery truck with various truck capacities and customers’ constraints.
"Currently, employees manually planned the truck scheduling based on their experiences."
"However, the analytical results of vehicle planning in the past indicated that most truck delivery plans were not matched between numbers of goods and the truck capacity."
"Consequently, the freight cost was increased and could not guarantee that the actual shipping is compiled to the plans."
"Therefore, a mathematical model was developed and applied to assist in the decision making on the vehicle planning."
The proposed model resulted in reducing number of trips and transportation costs compared to the existing vehicle planning methods.
The result for transportation costs was reduced by 5.76% as well as the total number of shipments was decreased by 3.35% within 30 days.
