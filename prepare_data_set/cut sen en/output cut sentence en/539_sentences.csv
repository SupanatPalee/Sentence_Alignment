This research aimed to investigate the heat transfer in 2D fireclay brick in steady state with finite element method.
A quadrilateral fireclay brick was fixed.
"In this work, the modeling approach was divided into two cases: the study on effects of different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios (AR)."
"The results of model simulations to change boundary conditions showed that, the modeling approach was divided into three model: (1) three surfaces of surface temperature (Ts) = 270°C and one surface of air temperature (T¥) = 27°C (2) two surfaces of Ts= 270°C and two surface of T¥= 27°C (3) one surface of Ts= 270°C and three surfaces of T¥= 27°C."
"The results showed that average temperature of surface in model 1, 2 and 3 were 189.66, 141.41 and 90.71 °C, respectively."
The directions of temperature distribution form the corner with high temperature difference.
"The side which had a great different temperature provides high gradient temperature, especially at the corners."
"Further the results of change in AR by used boundary condition of first model, it was found that an increase in AR on average temperature reduction."
"By comparing validation of model-predicted with finite different method, the temperature of each node was similar."
