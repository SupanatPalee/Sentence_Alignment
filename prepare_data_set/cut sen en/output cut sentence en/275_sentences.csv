This research uses simulation to improve paddy processing.
The objective is to reduce the amount of rice in the process.
The problem is classified into 2 cases: 1) the paddy dehumidification process and 2) the rice milling process in a plant.
This research develops two decision procedures that construct systematical condition for choosing the paddy dehumidification method that reduces paddy in the dehumidification process.
"Moreover, in this research, line balancing is used for determining the number of proper machines in a plant."
The objective is to reduce the amount of rice in a plant.
The simulation results show that the decision procedure no.
"1 combine with increase of 11 machines in total, give an appropriate result for the research."
"The average amount of rice in the paddy dehumidification process and the rice milling process are reduced by 84.08% and 70.18%, respectively."
"Furthermore, the result shows the opportunity to sell more products, which can increase the average profit by 574,714.72 baht per month."
