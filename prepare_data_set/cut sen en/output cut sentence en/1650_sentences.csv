"The objective of this study was to investigate effect of crude extracts from the leaves of rested celosin (Celosia cristata) extracted with different solvents including distilled water, boiled water and 30, 60 and 95% ethanol on inhibition Staphylococcus aureus and antioxidant activity."
The result showed that rested celosin leaves extracted with 60% ethanol displayed the highest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus (p<0.05) with the diameter of clear zone equal to 9.23Â±0.64 mm.
"The 60% ethanol extracts of rested celosin leaves had the values of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using broth dilution method and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) using agar dilution method as 83 and 166 mg/ml, respectively."
"Moreover, the rested celosin leaves extracted with 95% ethanol exhibited the highest antioxidant activities as compared to other solvents (p<0.05)."
Antioxidant activities of rested celosin leaves extracted with 95% ethanol (3mg/ml) was 85.15% based on DPPH radical scavenging while ferric reducing ability was equal to 1.08 mmol Fe2+ determined by FRAP assay.
