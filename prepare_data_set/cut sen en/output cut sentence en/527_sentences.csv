"This research aims to study the adaptation of probiotic bacteria with organic and inorganic acid to monitor the survival of probiotics in acidic conditions, the condition found in stomach and in simulated fruit juice."
"According to the studies, it has been found that, adaption of the cell with hydrochloric acid, and inorganic acid, promoted the acid resistance of Lactobacillus casei in citric acid solution and in simulated fruit juice."
"In the condition that malic acid was the main acid component, the cell adaptation with organic acid causes more acid tolerance of the cell."
"However, preparation of the cell with organic and inorganic acid showed the same acid tolerance of the Lactobacillus in simulated stomach condition."
"The sugar content in the adapted solution was determined and found that in hydrochloric acid adjusted solution, sugar utilization of the cells was significantly lower than in the organic acid adjusted solution."
This indicates the cell adaption process and the response mechanism of the cell to organic and inorganic acid were not the same.
