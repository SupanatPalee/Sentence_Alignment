A Geo-informatics System is proposed to automate Calculation of Coconut Productivity in Samut Songkhram Province is a system to calculate coconut productivity by using spectral reflectance of satellite image to classify coconut productivity.
The objective of this research estimates coconut productivity by using spectral mixture analysis for find out object in the pixel of satellite data.
This technique can help to accuracy classification.
Spectral reflectance of coconut is around 0.7-0.8 micrometers.
"The result of this research finds out 30*30 meters’ pixel of satellite data have 15,730 pixels for full of coconut in contrast 20-29% of the pixel has coconut have 345 pixels."
Amphawa district is area have most coconut.
"For accuracy, checking uses 300 for sampling."
That find out 70% for accuracy checking (210 GCP /300 GCP)
