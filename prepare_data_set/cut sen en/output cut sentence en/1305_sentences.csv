"Nowadays, there is a great increase in underground constructions."
"Therefore, it is necessary to develop the construction technique to increase efficiency of soil retaining structure."
Movement of soil protection system can be decreased by many ways.
This research aims to study the use of soil cement column to increase the stability of sheet pile wall by focusing on the movement of wall and soil failure.
"Three types of soil cement columns are installed:,i.e, soil cement columns which attached to the sheet pile wall, soil cement columns which were perpendicular to the sheet pile wall, and soil cement columns which located on both active side and passive side of the sheet pile wall."
"This research is conducted by using physical sand model, whereas sand internal friction angel is 29.9 O."
"The result shows that by installing the soil cement columns which were perpendicular to sheet pile in active side can increase a friction resistance around the soil cement column, and increase a stability of retaining wall system and this installation type can decrease wall movement more than other methods."
