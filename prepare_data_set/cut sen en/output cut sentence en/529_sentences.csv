TheÂ Thailand 4.0 policy that focuses on applying technology is the idea that pushes the economy with innovation and to become a part of the ASEAN Community.
It is the time of major changes for the construction industry.
Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the idea and the process that has been developed to solve the construction management starting from the designing process.
"This idea supports the construction design by the computer system which is able to indicate the physical data, working characteristics of the buildings, and to demonstrate the data in a 3D model, including bill of quantity."
This technology can be applied to several works such as representing bidding document or project presentation to related persons or planning of construction and resource management.
"Moreover, it increases the safety in the operation, not only the designing process but also the modeling of project delivery after the completion."
This research purposed to study obstacles and promotion of BIM application for contractors.
The random sampling method was used to select the sample group of 70 people who associated with construction companies.
The 5-rating scales questionnaire was the tool.
"According to the study, the application of BIM can be divided into 5 main topics, considering from the highest mean to the least mean; there are the obstacle of knowledge has the mean at 4.42, the obstacle of working type of the organization at 4.19; the obstacle of hardware technology at 3.88, respectively."
"The forth and the fifth remain at the medium level, which are the obstacle of personal attitude at 3.24 and the obstacle of software technology at 3.23, respectively."
"And, for the contractors, there were two guidelines for encouragement in BIM application as follows: (1) the construction project owners should be supported in putting the BIM as one of requirements in TOR for selecting contractors, and (2) the personnel should be supported in enhancing their knowledge and ability on application of the program for supporting BIM."
