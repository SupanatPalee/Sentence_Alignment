The objective of this research was to improve the efficiency of Arabica parchment coffee sorting using the ECRS technique and ergonomics.
The study focused on the process of sorting parchment coffee manually and investigated the working methods using a left-right hand diagram.
"The aim was to find ways to standardize the working process by applying the principles of ECRS, which include ‘eliminate’, ‘combine’, ‘rearrange’, and ‘simplify’."
"Additionally, the research applied ergonomic principles to improve the parchment coffee sorting process."
"After studying the pre-improvement sorting process, which consisted of 16 steps, it was found that the average time taken by workers to sort parchment coffee was 3.54 minutes per kilogram."
"By implementing the principles of ECRS and ergonomics, unnecessary movements were reduced, unnecessary steps in the process were eliminated, a coffee bean sorting table was used, and sorting was done using both hands."
"The results showed that the working process was reduced to 7 steps, and the standard time for sorting parchment coffee by workers after the improvement was 3.06 minutes per kilogram, which is a reduction of 0.48 minutes per kilogram."
This indicates a 13.6% increase in the efficiency of parchment coffee sorting.
