"In this research, fly and bottom ash samples from Mae Moh power plant, Lampang, Thailand were reported by XRF."
The %Fe element in samples was nearly 10%.
The neodymium permanent magnet was used to remove iron impurities in wet process.
"The results showed reduction in fly and bottom ash to 6.02%Fe at magnetic flux density (B) = 3573 G and 5.23%Fe at B = 3705 G, respectively."
"The maximum %Fe recoveries were 90% and 79% in fly ash and bottom ash, respectively."
