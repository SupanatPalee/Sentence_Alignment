"Using the simulation technique, this research applied two replenishment models: Â 1) continuous review policy; and 2) periodic review policy, to the Central Supply Laundry Department (CSLD) in Songklanagarind Hospital."
The objective of this study was to reduce the inventory of fabrics in the medical wards and the number of trips to replenish the fabrics supported by the CSLD.
"In this research, two replenishment scenarios were presented according to a 99% service level."
The first scenario classified all fabric using the ABC method.
The continuous review policy was then applied to all fabrics in the A group while the fabrics in the other groups (B and C) were replenished using the periodic review policy.
In the second scenario all fabrics were replenished using the periodic review policy.
"Using the simulation technique, it was found that the second scenario was the most promising implementation method in this hospital case."
"In this scenario, 1,471 pieces in the daily fabric inventory could be reduced by 489 pieces (a decrease of 24.95 per cent), compared with the current situation."
"Conversely, there was an increase in the number of monthly trips of 76.67 per cent (from 92 trips to 212 trips)."
