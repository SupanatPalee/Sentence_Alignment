This paper present mathematical model of temperature in solar oven which performs in second-order partial differential equation.
The simulation that was applied to the development 3-D finite element method by MATLAB program and show the graphical of the temperature in solar oven and food.
"To compare used different 3 types of insulation are Polyurethane, Polystyrene and Glass wool."
