This study investigates the influence of indium on thickness of intermetallic compound layer of lead-free solder SAC305-0.5In on a copper substrate.
The samples in the experiment were alloying elements: SAC305 and SAC305-0.35In.
"In the experiment wettability, microstructure and thickness of intermetallic compound layer were analyzed."
"An independent variable was the temperature of 260oC and the dependent variables were three durations of time, namely, 30, 40 and 50 seconds."
The results of the study indicated that the chemical properties of SAC305 and SAC305-0.35In passed the standard criteria of all components.
The melting point of SAC305-0.35In was found to decrease for 3.8oC or 1.7% when compared to that of SAC305.
"The wettability of SAC305 and SAC305-0.35In with contact angle at temperature of 260oC for 30, 40 and 50 seconds had a tendency to decrease with increasing time."
"In terms of microstructure, the phase of Ag3(Sn,In) and Cu6(Sn,In)5 appeared when an amount of indium increased."
"In addition, the intermetallic compound layer remaining between copper and both types of lead-free solder was Cu6Sn5."
