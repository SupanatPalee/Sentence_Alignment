This article aims for a feasibility study about a barge service business.
"The study includes marketing, techniques, management, finance, and economics."
"Data from the literature and interviews of entrepreneurs doing business in barge and tug services on the Chao Phraya River and Pa Sak River are used to estimate the cost, return on investment, and the cargo volume forecasting."
"According to the study, marketing is feasible, because the cargo volume, especially fuel, minerals and cement, on the Chao Phraya River and Pa Sak River tends to be increasing continuously."
"Meanwhile, the process of operation is not complicated in both of technique and management; it is not necessary to use a specialist but requires only an experienced operator."
"The study results indicate that the business of a barge and tugboat service requires investment of about 19,553,549 baht and the project period is 10 years."
"The net present value is 3,825,339 baht, the internal rate of return is 24.33 percent, the benefit-cost ratio is 1.53 times, and the payback period is 7 years and 7 months."
"Thus, the business is feasible for investment."
"Besides, the results of sensitivity analysis show that a changed factor such as reduced income could differ by 5 percent, or the costs increase by 10 percent, for the net present value to still be positive."
"If these two factors, the increased costs and the reduced income, change by five percent at the same time, the net present value would be negative."
