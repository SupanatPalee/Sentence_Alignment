This study investigated the mechanical and physical properties of geopolymer mortar and cement mortar reinforced with sisal fiber (SF).
"Fiber was used at the rate of 0 (control geopolymer mortar), 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00% by volume for geopolymer mortar; 0 (control cement mortar) and 0.75% by volume for cement mortar."
"The mechanical and physical properties including flow, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, porosity, water absorption, density and ultrasonic pulse velocity were tested."
"The results indicated that the used of sisal fiber reduced the flow of geopolymer and cement mortars, while the compressive strength of geopolymer mortar increased about 9-14% of control geopolymer mortar."
"The use of sisal fiber at the rate of 1.00% by volume had the highest splitting tensile and flexural strengths of geopolymer mortar at 34 kg/cm2 and 67 kg/cm2 or about 79% and 109% of control geopolymer mortar, respectively."
"For cement mortar, the compressive strength of 0.75% of sisal fiber mix gave nearly the same as control cement mortar and slightly higher than that of geopolymer mortar with same fiber content."
"Similar to geopolymer mortar, the used of sisal fiber in cement mortar increased the splitting tensile and flexural strengths."
"In addition, it was found that the porosity and water absorption of geopolymer and cement mortars tend to increase with fiber contents."
