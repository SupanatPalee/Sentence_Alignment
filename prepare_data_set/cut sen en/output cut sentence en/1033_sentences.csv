This research aims to present the color classification of banana chips from their photographs.
Color characterization analysis from RGB and HSV model is very useful for the semi-automatic banana chip machine which lacks of automatic systems for banana chip color classification.
"Therefore, this research develops the method to classify if banana chips are completely cooked by image processing techniques."
"The results of performance tests reveal that the percentages of color detection, recall, and precision were 86.27%, 83.06%, and 84.06% accuracy."
