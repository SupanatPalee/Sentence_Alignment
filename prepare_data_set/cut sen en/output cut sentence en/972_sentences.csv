"Ergonomically, a userâ€™s anthropometry and furniture are related."
"However, to produce furniture of exactly the right size for an individual is quite difficult."
"If multiple sizes are available, there will be a greater chance that a user can find an office desk and chair that is ergonomically suitable."
"Hence, the objectives of this research are to investigate the appropriateness of the current popular office desks and chairs, and propose the measurements for desk and chair sizes that would be more ergonomically appropriate for Thai office workers using k-mean clustering technique."
"For the furniture considered in this study, the office desk is 75 centimeters high, and the chair has seat height of 42 centimeters."
The match between the sample anthropometry and desk and chair size is 5.83% or 50 out of 857 participants.
"However, after defining 2(S and L) and 3(S M and L) sizes of desk and chair sets, the percents of match increase significantly; the two-size and three-size are 89.38% and 96.03%, respectively."
"Therefore, the 3 sizes: S, M and L are recommended for Thai office workers."
