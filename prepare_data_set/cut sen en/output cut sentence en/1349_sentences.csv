This paper proposes a technique to improve the BER performance of OFDM MISO downlink systems.
Time-domain oversampling and extended size of DFT matrix with an orthogonal frequency in OFDM demodulator those are applied to the receiver part of mobile station.
"The analytical result shows that the achievable diversity gain obtained from the proposed receiver is a product of the numbers of delay paths (L), transmit antennas (Mt) and oversampling factors (Z)."
The simulation results show that BER performance of the proposed receiver outperforms the MISO oversampling and MIMO conventional receivers in multipath fading channel with high Doppler speed.
