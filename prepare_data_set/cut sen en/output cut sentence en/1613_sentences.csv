"The research on application of the electrical resistivity determination of ground layer for the groundwater sources prediction was conducted to survey, and assesses the potential of the exploration points on developing groundwater sources for the community."
"A geophysical exploration via electrical resistivity method was employed to measure and analyze the soil layers at the survey points at Sokchan Pattana village, Makluea Kao subdistrict, Sung Noen district, Nakhon Ratchasima Province."
Experimental survey data were compared to the data of the groundwater wells at the nearby area.
"For the physical aspect, the result was shown that the data at the survey area of 7 points were aquifers that consistent with the geological data set of rocks Khok Kruat Formation."
"Geophysics aspect via exploration of a vertical electrical resistivity method, there were 2 points that seem to have potential of development for groundwater wells as: points A1 and A3."
"They could have groundwater at the depths of 34.65 and 39.74 meters, respectively."
"Whereas, the survey point A5 was likely to find groundwater at the depth of 62.5 meters."
It can be concluded that the surveyed areas have opportunity and trend to find groundwater in aquifers of Khok Kruat Formation.
The amount of water was at 2-20 cubic meters per hour at the depths between 30 and 90 meters with a good quality of water.
