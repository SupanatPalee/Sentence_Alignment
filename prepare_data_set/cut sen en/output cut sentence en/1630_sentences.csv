"The study of soil characteristics and carbon storages of the soils derived from different soil parent rocks was carried out in mixed deciduous forest (MDF) ecology at Huai Hong Khrai royal development study center (HHK), Chiang Mai province."
The objective is to study the potential of carbon storages in soil which develop from different types of rock.
"Six soil pits were made in the MDF, and soil composite samples were collected at different depths and characteristics of soil horizon."
The samples were collected for physicochemical properties analysis.
"Four groups of the soil parent rocks were found; sandstone, shale, andesite and limestone."
"The variation of soils was in the stage of the beginning to high development and soils were classified into Order Inceptisols, Ultisols, and Vertisols."
"The most storage of carbon at 1 meter depth were andesite followed shale, limestone and sandstone, with 152.73, 115.90, 83.29 and 53.02-81.48 t/ha, respectively."
"According to the development and restoration of the forest under the royal initiative of His Majesty King Rama the IX, the forest was restored and has the potential to be a service for ecosystem, especially soil carbon storage."
