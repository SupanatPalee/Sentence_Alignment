Haloacetonitriles (HANs) are in the group of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs).
HANs are more toxicity than regulated DBPs (trihalomethames and haloacetic acids).
"This work investigated the removal of monochloroacetonitrile (MCAN), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN) using UV-LED/Cl2 in comparison with UV-LED alone and Cl2 alone at pH 7 and 8."
The results showed that the relationship between the decreasing of HAN concentration and time was the first order reaction.
"At pH 7, MCAN and DCAN removals under the UV-LED/Cl2 process had degradation rate constants (MCAN = 5.6 × 10-3 min-1, DCAN = 11.7 × 10-3 min-1) and removal efficiencies (27-52%) higher than UV-LED (MCAN = 4.4 × 10-3 min-1, DCAN = 5.1 × 10-3 min-1) and Cl2 (MCAN = 2.4 × 10-3 min-1, DCAN = 5.3 × 10-3 min-1)."
"However, removal of DBAN under the UV-LED process was found to have a rate constant (6.4 × 10-3 min-1) and removal efficiency higher than UV-LED/Cl2 (5.6 × 10-3 min-1) and Cl2 (4.5 × 10-3 min-1)."
One-way ANOVA statistical results showed that HANs removal by UV-LED/Cl2 UV-LED and Cl2 processes were significantly different (p < 0.05).
"However, no statistically different for HANs removals among three processes at pH 8 (p > 0.05)."
The results of this work suggested that UV-LED/Cl2 can be an alternative method to remove HANs in drinking water.
