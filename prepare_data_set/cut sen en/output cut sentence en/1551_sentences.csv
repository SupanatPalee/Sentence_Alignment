This research aims to study the orbital period of the eclipsing binary star V1848 Ori.
"There was observed using a 0.7-meter diameter automated telescope at TRT-GAO Gao Mei Gu Observatory, China."
The eclipsing binary star system V1848 Ori is a-type W UMa eclipsing binary star system.
"When analyzing the light curve generated by the photometry method, In the blue, yellow, red and infrared wavelengths, the minimum light time is 2457715.3013."
The new linear Ephemeris equation is Min l=24574066.4304938797+0.2663479709E.
"For Oâ€“C analysis, the orbital period of the binary star V1848 Ori is known to have a longer period with an orbital period increase rate of 0.045627 seconds per year."
This is the effect of a mass transfer between the member stars in the eclipsing binary system V1848 Ori.
