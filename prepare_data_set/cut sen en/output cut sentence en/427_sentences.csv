This project studied the effect of nickel loading on Ni-Al2O3 catalyst with preparation by co-precipitation method.
"The amount of NiO was 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%wt."
"The catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, TEM and SEM-EDS techniques."
"Then, the synthesized catalysts were activated with H2 superior to test with deoxygenation of oleic acid in a batch reactor."
The reaction was operated at a temperature of 310°C for 4 h using H2 pressure of 40 bar and analyzed the product with gas chromatograph.
The characterization results revealed that the presence of crystal phase of β-Ni(OH)2 and Al(OH)3 was obtained for non-activation Ni-Al2O3 catalyst synthesized by co-precipitation.
The synthesized catalysts were mesoporous structures.
"Moreover, only 19%wt of Ni metal was detected on the alumina surface."
The catalytic activities via deoxygenation were determined using Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst activated with H2.
The 80Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst provided 68% conversion of oleic acid with maximum C17 yield via decarbonylation and decarboxylation.
54% of C14-C18 yield as a green diesel was obtained at reaction time of 240 min.
"This was due to the 80Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst was the highest Ni on the catalyst surface area, high NiO dispersion and high average pore size."
"While, 0Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst could not be active for deoxygenation, this can be seen from the lowest hydrocarbon yield less than 1%."
