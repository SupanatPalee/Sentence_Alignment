This paper presents seismic behavior of precast concrete (PC) load bearing wall panels widely constructed in Thailand through experimental and analytical programs.
A quasi-static reversed cyclic loading test was conducted on an Â¼ scaled PC load bearing wall panels to investigate and evaluate cyclic responses of the wall.
The analytical program was verified with the experimental results using PERFORM3D.
"The PC wall specimen and the cast-in-situ foundation was connected using welded, short reinforcing steels."
The connection was later grouted using nonshrink grout cement to achieve a structural integrity.
The experimental results obviously indicated that the specimen could develop large strength and stiffness.
"However, after reaching its peak, the force-deformation of the wall was dramatically dropped and the specimen was failed."
Analytical study also shows a good agreement with test results.
The results reveal that the wall could be constructed in low seismic hazard area by considering that the walls behave within elastic range.
