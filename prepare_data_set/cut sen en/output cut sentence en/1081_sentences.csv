This research presents programming guidelines for controlling automated systems designed based on the state machine diagram concept.
"This will help to develop software efficiently within the software development cycle and reduce the problem of inconsistency in programming, improving code understanding regardless of the programming language."
The experiments are divided into two cases.
The first part uses the C++ language to write programs on a microcontroller.
The second part uses the ladder language to write programs on a PLC.
This will develop software according to the requirements of the competition for the training set of the MPU-A automatic drilling system.
"The test results show that following this new approach results in both controllers working properly according to the system requirements, with a common programming style."
"However, response times may vary depending on the hardware of controllers."
