"In this paper, we present the pigment separation for color model of foliage plant using principal component analysis."
Spatial distributions of pigments lead to the variation of color.
Leaf color model is based on the Lambert-Beer law by using principal component analysis.
"In order to separate pigments of leaf, we assume to separate only two groups of pigments as green pigment and aging pigment."
Results can use to the analysis of leaf texture and the diagnosis of leaf disease.
Simulation results show that the pigment components are influential factor of different color separated from leaf color image.
