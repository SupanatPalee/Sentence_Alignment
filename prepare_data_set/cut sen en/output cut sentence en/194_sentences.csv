This paper presents an analysis of heat conduction in one-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system under steady state condition for homogeneous material by using the dual mesh finite domain method.
This method used element for interpolation of functions and the calculation of heat fluxes at both ends of control domain.
"In this paper, the detail of discrete equation formulation was presented for the nodes of domain."
"The accuracy of numerical solutions was evaluated by comparison with the exact solutions of three problems including 1) heat conduction in a rod without heat generation, 2) heat conduction in a plane wall with heat generation and 3) heat conduction through a fin with uniform cross section."
"The percentage of error of the dual mesh finite domain method with four elements for problem 1, 2 and 3 were 0, 0 and 0.01, respectively."
