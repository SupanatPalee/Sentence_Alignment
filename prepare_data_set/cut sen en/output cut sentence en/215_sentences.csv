This research project develops an application for searching lost pets by using image recognition.
The system development comprises two parts: 1) the recognition engine which employs convolutional neural networks and 2) the user interface of the application for visualizing the search results.
"For the recognition engine, the process consists of background removal, features extraction with InceptionV3 technique, and recognition modeling for displaying on the app developed by using Solar2D."
The preliminary experiments show promising results in terms of the search accuracy and user’s satisfaction and experience.
"In our cat picture database of 152 cats, the system can correctly classify the pet pictures with 87.51% averaged accuracy."
The user satisfaction of using the app is 4.55 (out of 5) based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) as an evaluation tool.
