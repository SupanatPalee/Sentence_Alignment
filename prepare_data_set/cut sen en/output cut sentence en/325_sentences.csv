The purpose of this quasi-experimental research was to determine the percentage of weight loss in volatile suspended solids during the process of total suspended solids analysis by microwave.
The electrical energy was also compared between standard method and microwave with decreased costs.
"The result showed that the total suspended solids analyzed by 800-watt microwave at High level with the duration periods of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 minutes provided the weight loss of total suspended solids at 0.9, 1.4, 3.3, 4.1, and 4.5 percent, respectively."
"The electric energy consumption for total suspended solids analyzed by microwave was 0.005 - 0.026 THB/sample, while the cost of the standard method was 0.050 THB/sample."
"For total suspended solids analyzed per day, the microwave method was equal to the standard method when applied for 2 microwaves to 1 oven, thus decreasing the cost of oven purchase about 50,000 – 60,000 THB."
