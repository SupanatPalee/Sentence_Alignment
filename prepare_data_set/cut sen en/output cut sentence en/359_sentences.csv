This article presents an approach to identify the electrical appliances with leakage current in a low voltage 220VAC network by frequency analysis.
A voltage with particular frequency that corresponds to each electrical appliance is injected into its ground point when leakage current occurs.
A particular frequency will be found at the ground link in the main distribution board (MDB) using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique.
The performance of this method is verified by using the simulation program PSpice.
"Moreover, the prototype hardware with program LabVIEW is also implemented with the electrical appliances to show the effectiveness of this method."
