"People entering the workplace should be screened for COVID-19 by having their masks checked, their body temperatures taken, and their hand hygiene kept with alcohol gel."
"In order to detect mask wearing, this study applied image processing and a deep learning neural network using a Raspberry Pi board as a technology for preliminary assessments."
A wireless temperature sensor and spoken instructions were also used to display the body temperature on an LCD panel.
"When someone passed the mask-wearing inspection, the system alerted them to use the gel dispenser, which was turned on by a servo motor instruction and a palm detecting ultrasonic sensor."
The gate barrier would open to provide entrance to the service once the screening was complete.
The computer algorithm used in this study achieved a 97.2% accuracy rate in detecting masks.
The effectiveness of the workplace screening system was 21.54 seconds per person.
It was found that the system could be used to screen people entering the workplace.
