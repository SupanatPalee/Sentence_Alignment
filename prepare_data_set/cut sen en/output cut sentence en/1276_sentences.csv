Nowadays engineers and architects utilized various polymeric coating fabrics extensively for architectural works.
"For design and application of fabric, the heat transfer coefficient play an important role as a key factor."
The heat transfer coefficient of the fabrics cannot be measured directly by the standard equipment due to the following reasons: 1) fabric thinness 2) being a composite material and 3) being an imporous material.
"Therefore, the researcher follows the standard ASTM C518 as a guideline for inventing the heat generating equipment."
"This equipment consists of heating plate, cooling plate, temperature control system, heating flux sensors, temperature sensors, architecture fabric, and data logger."
The equipment is designed in a way that all parts can be assembled and dissembled easily.
The architectural fabrics made from polyester (PES) polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with known heat transfer coefficients are used for calibrating the equipment with the average error of 1.60%.
"Thus, this equipment works effectively and deliver precise measurement of heat transfer coefficient."
The result shows that the values of heat transfer coefficients ranges from 0.043 to 0.058 W/m.K.
The linear equation is 0.1543x + 0.0029 where the indepentdent variable x is the thickness of the architecture fabric (0.08 to 0.18 mm).
