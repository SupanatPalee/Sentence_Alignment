The purposes of design of sugarcane shoot tip and corn dairy cows  were to present in this article which provides basic information on the physical characteristics of  Marcos and sugarcane varieties Suwan corn varieties.
Have been used as a condition in the design of a power sowing machine using a power walking tractor.
"By testing for the optimum speed 700 revolution per minute at feed rate of 3 kilogram, the size after chopped  was 2.5 centimeters, the capability in chopping is 607.10 kilograms per hour for the sugarcane shoot tip and is 685.59 kilograms per hour for the corn."
The percentages of loss for sugarcane shoot tip and corn are 5 and 5.7 percents respectively.
The chopping performance for sugarcane shoot tip and corn are 95 and 94.3 percent respectively.
The use of the proposed cutting machine can help reduce labor costs.
"Save time to increase productivity, it will give the break even point at 47,825.55 kilograms per year with a profit of 324,266.78 baht per year."
"The payback period is 22 days, and when taking the machine for corn chopping, it will give the break even point at 46,566.98 kilograms per year with a profit of 378,895.82 baht per year and the payback period is 19 days."
