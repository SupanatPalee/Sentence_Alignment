"Nowadays, technology is used in construction projects to facilitate workers, planners and other stakeholders in the process of monitoring and evaluating construction progress."
This research aims to propose the way to monitor the construction project progress using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and apply with the photogrammetry technology to create a three-dimensional model and visualize the construction overview of the project for quickly monitor and evaluate the construction work.
"The case study is reinforced concrete building project in Khonkaen province, This research used photos taken  from UAV to generate three-dimensional model base on point cloud, The geometry of building was measured manually from the model by its length and area of ​​each part of the  model."
Then the data was analyzed for the error compared to the actual size of the building from the construction drawings.
"The results showed the error of the developed model was less than 1%, This paper proved that three-dimensional construction model base on point cloud from construction site images can be used to evaluate construction progress with enough accuracy."
