The new version of the GAWA - 2019 model using Java Script and ASP is developed.
"The study area located at the lower Chao Phraya Basin between the Chao Phraya River and Tha Chin River, with a total of 131 nodes in this system."
"The schematic diagram has been set up, including canal flows 175 reaches."
"The appropriate GAs parameters included as follows: the number of 100 alternative sets of Probability of Crossover (Pc) was 0.088, Probability of Mutation (Pm) was 0.00787, and the penalty factors of water balance R1, R2 and R3 were equal to 1, 1 and 4, respectively."
All Supply = 692.600 m3/s and All Supply calculation by GAWA - 2019 = 692.591 m3/s.
The result shows equitable manners of the systems answers the desired objectives allocation and provide opportunities to access water resources in all sectors appropriately.
I could help optimize the water allocation in the irrigation system and reduce in equitable at real time conflicts.
