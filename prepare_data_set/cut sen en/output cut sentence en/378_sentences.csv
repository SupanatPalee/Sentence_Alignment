This research discusses the treatment of petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated seawater by chemical oxidation.
"The 52 µg/l of chrysene contaminated in synthetic seawater was reacted with 3 types of oxidizing agents:  potassium permanganate, sodium persulfate, and sodium percarbonate in solution with vary the amount and/or concentration to be 25%, 50%, 100%, 125% and 150% of required reactant calculated by complete oxidation stoichiometry."
The remaining chrysene content was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry using hexane solvent as the extraction agent.
"The experimental results show that 50% stoichiometry amount of sodium persulfate solution could remove chrysene from synthetic seawater very well as the best, next was 150 stoichiometry amount of potassium permanganate solution and lastly 100% stoichiometry amount of sodium percarbonate solution."
"The highest efficiency in removing chrysene compounds from synthetic contaminated seawater was 94.62%, 89.87% and 70.79% respectively."
