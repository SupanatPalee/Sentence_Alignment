"The elder travelers are classified in 2 groups, including (1) aged more than 60 years old and (2) aged range between 45 and 60 years old."
There are 204 samples.
The confirmatory factor analysis was carried out in the study.
"The value of X2 and df are assigned 72.331 and 58, respectively."
"The results show that the X2/df, CMIN-p, GFI, TLI, CFI, RMSEA and SRMR are 1.247, 0.098, 0.955, 0.955, 0.993, 0.996, 0.035 and 0.021, respectively."

This research investigates the factor for the evaluation of the public transport (i.e.
"vehicle condition, staff service, time schedule of the bus and physical appearance of the bus station)."
"The most important factor is physical appearance of the bus station (0.914) which is statistically significant at the 0.01 level, these include: facilities for elders, adequate accommodation, enough bathroom and clean, including public relations."
