The objective of the research was to study the shelf-life of Hom thong banana with gaseous ozone on different concentrations to ethylene biosynthesis inhibition.
"The study was divided into 4 parts, namely, the study of ethylene production and respiration rate behavior of Hom thong banana, the study of gaseous ozone concentration on closed container, the study of reaction ratio between gaseous ozone to ethylene and the study of the appropriate gaseous ozone concentration for extending the shelf-life of Hom thong banana."
"The parameter was divided into 5 treatments as follows: control, ozone to ethylene ratio 2:1, 4:1, 6:1 and 12:1."
The results showed that the Hom thong banana produce the highest ethylene production on the days 6 of the experiment is 5.58 Î¼l/kg-hr.
"In addition, respiration rate using the carbon dioxide production of the Hom thong Banana was found on days 4 with 20.38 mg/kg-hr."
The study of gaseous ozone concentration the deterioration time inside the closed container can be applied to control the fumigation process.
The results showed that optimum gaseous ozone concentration for extending the shelf-life of Hom thong banana with the ratio of gaseous ozone to ethylene of 6:1 was the optimum ratio which can extend the Hom thong banana shelf-life for a longer time of 4 days.
While maintaining the quality according to the specified standards.
Compared to the quality of the Hom thong banana from the local market.
