Prototype mapping robot is to study the systems and methods for mapping simulation and control of various functions of the robot.
An Arduino MEGA2560 is programmed using an integrated development environment (IDE) in order to control the robot motion and odometry.
Sensors are used to analyze the environment and control the robot path for simulating the map.
This paper is to focus on the principle of odometry and how to use it on prototype mapping robot.
Experimental results show that the movement of the robot can move and simulate the map.
We found that the skid steering and position drift in the direction of the robot’s movement can cause errors.
