The present research investigated heat transfer in a rectangular duct with V-shaped baffles by using air as the heat transfer fluid.
"The V-shaped baffles were fabricated from twisted tapes having twist ratios (y/w) of 2, 3, 4, and 5."
"The baffles were installed with pitch ratios (p/w) = 4, 6, 8,10, and 12."
"Experiments were carried out in the Reynolds number range of 4,000 to 20,000."
"The presence of the baffles facilitated turbulence within the duct, resulting in boosting both heat transfer and friction factor."
"The V-shaped baffles with the narrowest pitch ratio (p/w = 4) and a moderate twist ratio (y/w = 3), offered the best thermal performance factor which was as high as 2.02 meanwhile the baffles with p/w = 6, 8, 10, and 12 gave the maximum thermal performance factors of 1.99, 1.93, 1.85 and 1.82, respectively."
