"For this paper, we adopted the warehouse layout model for locating the single-floor inventory and proposed mathematical model for multi-level warehouse layout under the fractional door usage condition in order to determine the influence of door usage on the product location."
The experiment on I/O different doors’ weight resulted in different product placements.
"Consequently, the proposed model provided the better result both for single level and multi-level warehouses."
"The expected travel distance for both single and multi-level warehouses were deceased by 30.97% and 37.05%, respectively compared to the existing product placement for single-floor storage and multi-floor warehouse."
