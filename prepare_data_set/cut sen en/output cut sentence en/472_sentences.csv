The objectives of this study is to develop an aluminum surface with hydrophobic properties of the surface by mechanical and chemical methods.
"The aluminum plate was polished with the sandpaper number 600, 800, 1000, and polishing and it was soaked in hydrochloric acid and oxalic acid for 14 hours, and the aluminum surface characteristics were analyzed using various techniques, including SEM, AFM, XPS and hydrophobic testing by measuring the contact angle."
The AFM technique revealed that the sample that had been polished with number 800 sandpaper had the highest surface roughness of 851.77 nanometers.
The hydrophobicity testing showed that the contact angle of water droplets on the aluminum surface was the highest at 140.92o.
This indicates that a higher surfaces roughness leads to a larger contact angle and better hydrophobic properties.
