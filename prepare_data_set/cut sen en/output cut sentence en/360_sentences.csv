"In general, the oil and gas petroleum industry or petrochemicals use the pipeline inspection gauges (PIG) by entering the PIG inside the pipeline to inspect the corrosion or deterioration of the pipeline."
"During the inspection process, this PIG will often be trapped in the pipeline because the uneven surface or bending of pipeline."
"In this research, we present the design and development of electromagnetic transmitter and receiver for pipeline inspection gauge to reduce dependence on foreign technology."
We use the property of electromagnetic wave frequency 22 Hz for communication between transmitter and receiver.
Microcontroller is used for processing to detect and calculate the position of PIG in the pipeline.
It will be tested with the diameter of pipeline size 6 inches and the thickness 7.11 millimeters.
"From our experiment results, the transmitter and receiver can communicate effectively at the frequency of 22 Hz."
"The farthest distance detection in the vertical and horizontal is 12 and 10 cm, respectively, and provides the average correctness of position detection as 94%."
