This research presents the design and construction of a hydroponic plant by comparing the growth between sunlight and artificial light from red and blue LEDs during daylight hours.
The duration for planting is 5 weeks.
The plants taken in this experiment were Chinese mustard greens.
The results found that greenhouses for cultivating Chinese mustard greens using sunlight and artificial light are controlled in accordance with standard measuring equipment.
Plants grown using LED artificial light grow better than plants grown with sunlight because the intensity of sunlight is unstable and insufficient to meet the needs of plants.
"As the weather conditions fluctuate, the planted plants do not grow fully."
Growing plants using controlled LED bulbs can replace sunlight for growing plants when there is little sunlight.
