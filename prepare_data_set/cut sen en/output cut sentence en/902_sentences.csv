"The aim of this research was to design, develop, and evaluate the performance of cardboard prototypes to promote learning in robotic technology."
This research sought to provide a way for interested parties to develop their own robots in various forms.
"The programming board “NodeMCU” using C language and able to be designed and developed for use in the detection of gas and smoke, was used in this research."
This research had 3 objectives: 1) to design and develop a robot prototype; 2) to assess the participants’ (n = 18) satisfaction with the robot prototype design and their development; and 3) to assess the performance of the prototype robot.
"The results of the experiment are as follows: 1) assessment in 5 areas of the design and development of the robot prototype using cardboard showed a good level (4.23/5, standard deviation = 0.73); 2) assessment of the participants’ satisfaction showed a good level (3.79/5, standard deviation = 0.64); and 3) the prototype robot could display output from the screen according to the instructions of the program at a good level: the gas and smoke detector using gas from the lighter was performed 10 times with the unit measured in part per million (ppm)- average of the gas was 412.2 ppm."
