This research aims to study the optimistic ratio between lignite powder and dried casuarina  junghuhniana miq.
leaf to make compound briquettes.
"The briquettes were made to have 3.5 cm outside diameter, 10 cm inside diameter and 10 cm long."
"Lignite powder and dried casuarinas leaf were blended using sodium hydroxide solvent with concentration of 0%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% w/v respectively."
The ratios between lignite power and dried casuarina  junghuhniana miq.
"leaf implemented in this study were 100:0, 90:10, 70:30 and 50:50 w/w."
"The physical properties of the briquettes focused in this study are compressive strength, density, shatter index, calorific value and thermal efficiency."
The results showed that the ratio of 70:30 with 1% concentrate solvent was found to produce output corresponding to the Thai Community Product Standard.
"It gives 5,322.25 cal/gram calorific value, density of 0.78 gram/cm3, 0.46 shatter index and compressive strength of 0.83 Mpa."
"In addition, it was found that the briquettes obtained from this ratio were set on fire easier than those with the ratios of 90:10 and 50:50."
It was found to produce the medium high orange flame with burning period of 74 minutes and burning calorific value of 643.01 cal/gram.
"After burning, ash content was found to be 31.44% and thermal efficiency of 34.62 %"
