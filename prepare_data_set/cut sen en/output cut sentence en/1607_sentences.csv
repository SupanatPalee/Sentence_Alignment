"The aim of this study was to assess some heavy metal contaminations such as lead, cadmium, copper, zinc and iron in paddy soils of 3 districts such as Sri-samrong District, Muang District and Kong-krailat District, Sukhothai Province."
"The results showed that the averaged iron content in paddy soils had the highest value with 3,576.35±1,325.13 mg/kg (ranged between 961.88-6689.38 mg/kg), followed by averaged zinc of 30.78±10.27 mg/kg (ranged between 7.55-74.10 mg/kg), averaged lead 15.49±8.97 mg/kg (ranged between ND-34.08 mg/kg), and averaged copper 15.29±5.84 mg/kg (ranged between 3.10-30.03 mg/kg), respectively."
Cadmium contents in all paddy soils were not detected at any sites.
These heavy metal contaminations in paddy soils were within the established standards.
