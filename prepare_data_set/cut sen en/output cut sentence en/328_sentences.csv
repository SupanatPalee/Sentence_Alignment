Manganese contamination causes problem for water consumption.
This research aims to investigate manganese removal using entrapped microbial cells.
The influence of an activated carbon content and a microbial cell density in entrapment material on manganese removal was focused.
Streptomyces violarus strain SBP1 (a biological manganese-oxidizing bacterium) and barium alginate supplemented with powdered activated carbon (entrapment material) were chosen.
"The experiment divided into 3 parts, including 1) manganese removal by barium alginate supplemented with powdered activated carbon (1, 5, and 10%, w/v), 2) manganese removal by the powdered activated carbon-barium alginate-entrapped cells at different microbial cell densities (100, 200, and 500 mg/L), and 3) entrapped cell micro-structural investigation using scanning electron microscope."
The result showed that microbial cell density and powdered activated carbon supplement obviously affected manganese removal efficiency.
Barium alginate with 5% powdered activated carbon supplement provided the highest manganese removal (42%).
The powdered activated carbon-barium alginate-entrapped cells at microbial cell density of 200 mg/L gave the best manganese removal (51%).
Micro-structural observation showed that powdered activated carbon and microbial cells distributed over the material.
These results could be used as a fundamental information for entrapped cell application for water treatment system in the future.
