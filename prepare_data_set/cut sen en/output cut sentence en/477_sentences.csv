This research aims to study the bioactivity of stainless steel AISI 304 and AISI 316 coated with hydroxyapatite using spraying method.
"After being coated, the samples were sintered at 900 ºC."
The results showed that the surface roughness value increased when coating procedure.
The AISI 316 stainless steel has a higher roughness than AISI 304 and when used to test the hydrophobic and hydrophobic properties by measuring the contact angle of water droplets on the surface.
"The coated sample have a contact angle greater than 90º, showing hydrophobic properties."
The bioactivity test showed that AISI 316 stainless steel coated with hydroxyapatite and sintered showed better bioactivity than AISI 304 stainless steel.
"However, both grades of coated stainless steel AISI 316 and AISI 304 exhibit hydroxyapatite crystallization in the form of calcium phosphate."
Which shows good biological compatibility and the potential for bone formation.
