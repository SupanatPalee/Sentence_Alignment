This research aims to study the parametric analysis on the behaviour of dam constructed by the composite contiguous pile wall and deep mixing column wall as a new alternative dam structure.
"The selected case study is the dam in Lake Legend Chaengwatthana project, Bangkok, Thailand."
"This dam was constructed in a deep rainwater pond without providing the water removal, which could save on both time and cost construction."
"In the parametric studies, there were the embedment depth of contiguous pile wall, the water level in a lake, the stiffness of soil-cement column wall and the depth of improvement by deep mixing method which were investigated on the stability of dam in term of the lateral displacement of dam and the bending moment on the contiguous pile wall by the finite element method using PLAXIS 2D."
"The studies can be concluded as: the increase of the embedment depth of contiguous pile wall, the stiffness of soil-cement column wall and the depth of improvement by deep mixing method reduce the lateral displacement of dam significantly."
The increase in the different water level between both sides of dam can increase the lateral displacement but reduce the stability of dam significantly.
The bending moment on the contiguous pile wall reduces with the decrease of the embedment depth and the different water level.
Whereas the bending moment increase with the decrease of the soil-cement stiffness and the improvement depth.
"For all these study cases, it was confirmed that the maximum bending moment of outer wall was always higher than that of inner wall."
The outcome of this research will be fundamental to develop a design guideline of soil-cement column wall by deep mixing method in soft Bangkok clay and other similar soft clay deposits especially in Southeast Asian countries.
