This paper presents the stability analysis of a power-switching converter with an EMI filter for PV systems.
"Impedance comparison technique, typically used by EMI filter designers, is investigated."
The accuracy of this technique is compared to other techniques i.e.
"Bode plot, Nyquist plot, Pole-Zero plot, and closed-loop poles."
"From the simulated results, it can be concluded that the impedance comparison technique is valid, and the overall system is stable if the input impedance of a power-switching converter is at least 10 dB higher than the output impedance of an EMI filter only at some certain frequency."
