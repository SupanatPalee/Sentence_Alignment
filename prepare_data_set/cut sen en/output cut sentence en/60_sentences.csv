This paper proposes the impact to a technical loss in a distribution system because of the difference of distribution pattern and customer characteristics that customer characteristics are set at each load point on 7 case studies.
The study focuses on the integration of all types of consumer characteristics before spreading to all load points and distributing the customer characteristics in the case study patterns.
"In this paper, the proposed idea is tested on the distribution system that consists of 9 load points."
"The results are shown the daily technical loss of the first section of a transmission line or the section next to the source, all case studies are the same graph characteristics."
"If each load point of the distribution system has the different type of customer characteristics, technical losses which were calculated by the integration of all types of consumer characteristics was not accurate."
