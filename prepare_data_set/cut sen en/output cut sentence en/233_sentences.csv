This research aims at comparing creep properties obtained on welding 2.25Cr-1Mo steel using ER90S-G and ERNiCrMo-3 filler metals by TIG or GTAW process.
The samples were preheated at 250 °C for 30 minutes and post-weld heat-treated at 690 °C for 1 hour.
"The high temperature accelerated creep rupture test of 2.25Cr-1Mo welded samples was investigated over 139 to 315 MPa stress range at temperatures of 550, 600, and 650 °C."
The service lifetime of the welded materials can be predicted using the extrapolation of Larson-Miller parameter.
Creep surface fracture was investigated using SEM consisted of dimple ruptures and micro-voids coalescence in the fibrous matrix of the intercritical region of HAZ.
Similar high-temperature creeps service lives were found in both welded materials.
