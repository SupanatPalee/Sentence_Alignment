Impinging stream drying (ISD) is technology that has been studied worldwide.
"This article reviewed the principle of impinging stream, and research of ISD."
Most research were focused on designing and verifying factors affected the efficiency of ISD.
Drying materials a variety of materials can be used for drying.
"Drying materials are mostly agricultural products, including okara, rice paddy and parboiled rice."
"To assess the efficacy of ISD, volumetric water evaporation rate, volumetric heat transfer coefficient and energy consumption were determined in most research and a study by using a simulation for study the variables in an impinging stream dryer"
