This research aims to reduce waste in the forming punching process focusing on the vacuum flask model SP of Company A. Pareto diagram theory was used for considering a number of quantities of wastes that were generated in various forms.
It was found that the forming process was the highest number of waste.
"Therefore, the Cause and Effect diagram is carried out to determine the details of the cause of the problem."
Lack of a device for determining a workpiece's position is a cause of waste generated.
This research is focused on tools and devices to assist in position determining that design based on Tool Engineering theory.
"After applying the device, the result found that the tool can be used to reduce the waste from 4.34% to 0.75%."
