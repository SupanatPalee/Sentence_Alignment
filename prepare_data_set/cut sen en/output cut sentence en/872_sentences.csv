"The objectives of this research were to 1) synthesize the conceptual framework of the activity-based learning model using virtual interactive micro-learning on cloud community, 2) to develop the activity-based learning model using virtual interactive micro-learning on cloud community, 3) to develop the activity-based instruction process using virtual interactive micro-learning on cloud community, 4) to study the suitability of activity-based learning model using virtual interactive micro-learning on cloud community, and 5) to study the suitability of activity-based instruction process using virtual interactive micro-learning on cloud community."
"The sample group in the research, obtained into two groups from purposive sampling, includes 1) three experts in the development of instruction styles in higher education, and 2) three experts in the development of learning systems in higher education."
"The results showed that the activity-based learning model, and the developed activity-based instruction process using virtual interactive micro-learning on cloud community are highly appropriate to enhance digital literacy skills among students in digital era."
