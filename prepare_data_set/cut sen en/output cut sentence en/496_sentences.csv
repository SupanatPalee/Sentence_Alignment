The objectives of this study were to analyze the use of microcrystalline cellulose extracted from Typha angustifolia L. trees obtained from Songkhla province.
Microcrystalline cellulose was extracted from Typha angustifolia L. trees via hydrolysis treatment using sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
"The study found the Cellulose, Lignin, and Hemicelluloses to be 75.47, 8.33, and 9.40 %, respectively."
The morphology of the microcrystalline cellulose was characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).
The result of the physical properties showed a microcrystalline cellulose fiber length of up to 230 micrometers.
"Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the chemical composition and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) showed crystallinity microcrystalline cellulose appearing at peaks 16, 22, and 35 degrees in relation to the plane (101), (101), and (002), respectively."
The thermal stability was investigated using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method displayed the decomposition of carbon in the cellulose structure.
The detergent method result showed that Typha angustifolia L compound produced a high content of phase cellulose of up to 75 %.
