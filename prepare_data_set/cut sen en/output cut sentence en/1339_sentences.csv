ABTRACT This research article aims to increase an overall equipment effectiveness of the two color flexo printing machine in a process of corrugated paper box.
"From gathering data, the two color flexo printing machine has the lowest overall equipment effectiveness which is equal to 46%."
The causes come from long setup times and have machine downtimes.
The loss reduction from setting up with quick changeover including ECRS techniques result in higher availability rate.
Minor stoppages are analyzed with fishbone diagram and why-why analysis which reveals no inspection before starting up machine and no standard of feed speed for different paper sizes.
Doing a maintenance plan and write work instructions lead to lower amount of downtimes and higher performance efficiency.
Then the overall equipment effectiveness is higher to be 66%.
