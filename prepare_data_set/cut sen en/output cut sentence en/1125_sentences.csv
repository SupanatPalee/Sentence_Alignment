"In this research, the effect of air bubble addition on the heat transfer enhancement of a water impinging jet was investigated on a submerged smooth surface."
"The parameters for Reynolds number of water is 2.4 x 104, the ratio between the volumetric flow rate of the air to the total volumetric flow rate of 0.0 and 0.1 and the distance from the jet exit to the impingement surface at L = 2D, 4D, 6D, 8D and 10D were studied."
The behaviour of air bubbles in a water jet was visualized using a high-speed camera.
The heat transfer on the impingement surface was measured with a thermal imaging camera.
"According to the results, the air addition at the ratio between the volumetric airflow rate and the total volumetric flow rate was 0.1 for the impingement distance at L = 2D, 4D, 6D, 8D and 10D can increase the average Nusselt number along radial direction about 27.27%, 1.98%, 24.37%, 3.84% and 8.10%, respectively, compared to the case of the pure water jet."
This is caused by the behaviour of small air bubbles that coalesce to form large bubbles and then impinged against the surface and small air bubbles that impinge on the surface and disturb the thermal boundary layer.
