The purpose of this research was to study wettability and microstructure for SAC305 and SAC305-0.5In lead-free solders on copper substrate.
"The melting point of lead-free solder alloys was analyzed by the Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC, NETZSCH, DSC 200 F3 Maia)."
"The wettability was studied by sessile drop method for the relationship between the spread factors, spread ratio, spreading area and contact angle of lead-free solder alloys."
"The parameters were used 2 factors 3 levels at 240, 260 and 300 °C and dwell time of 20, 30 and 60 seconds."
"As results, the addition of Indium 0.5 wt.% into SAC305 lead-free solder ratio were an increased to 91.25±0.53% and 7.75±0.34 times with increasing the soldering temperature, respectively."
"Whereas, the minimum average contact angle of SAC305-0.5In solder alloys on copper substrate was about 19.88±1.29 ° at 300 °C, 30 seconds and good wettability."
"Therefore, it found that thickness of intermetallic compound was an increased with the soldering temperature the an increasing and phase for intermetallic compound is Cu6Sn5"
