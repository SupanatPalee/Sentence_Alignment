The purposes of this research were to 1) develop a CIPP model for construction project evaluation and 2) test the developed CIPP model for the evaluation of various construction projects.
The sample group was those who worked in all five kinds of construction projects.
"Of these five categories, five people was sampled from each of the three projects."
A total of 75 samples participated in this research study.
The questionnaire was used as a tool to collect the data.
"The percentage, mean, standard deviation, the test of validity and reliability, and One-way ANOVA were used for analyzing the collected data."
"The results reveal that 1) the CIPP model for construction projects evaluation is divided into four parts, i.e."
"context evaluation, input evaluation, process evaluation and product evaluation; and 2) this CIPP Model is valid (IOC = 0.60 – 1.00) and highly reliable (α=0.840)."
"In other words, it can be applied for evaluating overall five construction project types, i.e."
"general building, residential building, road and transportation route, water resources and irrigation, and high-rise building, with the similar level of reliability."
