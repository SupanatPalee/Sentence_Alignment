Ozone (O3) is gas with good characteristic for disinfection application.
It can be used to disinfect in air and water media.
"In general, it can be naturally found in the normal environment."
"However, for disinfection application, the ozone concentration must be over 4 ppm."
"Therefore, in this research the corona discharge method was performed to generate the ozone by using high voltage high frequency technique."
The voltage was over 10 kV while the frequency was between 4-8 kHz.
The results showed that this condition was suitable to generate enough ozone concentration for disinfection application.
