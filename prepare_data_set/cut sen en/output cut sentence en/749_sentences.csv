"Due to a progress on transportation and manufacturing technology, there are a large amount of products which customers can choose."
"These consumer products, which are not only local made products but also export products, need to be controlled by a proper standard."
"With this standard, products will be in a good quality which will also be safe for customers."
Thailand Industrial Standard Institute (TISI) has a core mission in controlling product qualities.
A standard named “TIS” (this abbreviation stands for Thailand Industrial Standard) issuing by TISI is used to certified consumer product qualities.
"Generally, there are two steps in the certificating process which are (1)."
audit and certificate and (2).
annually monitor.
A standard monitoring division 5 which is a member of TISI has a main function in annually checking certified manufacturers to ensure a quality level.
This division is responsible for 192 manufacturers consisting of 520 certified products which cover 32 provinces in 7 regions.
An objective of this paper is to design planning procedure for establishing monitoring schedule.
"In general, this schedule is created in September of every year."
"Moreover, this schedule must be created with respect to two types of constraints which are hard and soft constraint."
The designed planning procedure comprises of 7 major steps which can be separated into 19 minor steps.
"Moreover, these 19 minor steps are arranged in a logical sequence."
"To ensure a performance of this planning procedure, the experiment on a practical case study are conducted."
"The results show that, with this procedure, a planning duration is decreased from 35 hours to 14 hours."
"Additionally, all constraints (both hard and soft constraints) are satisfied with this monitoring schedule."
This research aims to reduce the number of defects in the manufacturing process of nylon synthetic fibers.
"The approach involves using a fishbone diagram to analyze the root causes of the problem, Pareto charts to prioritize the issues, ECRS principles, and factorial experimental design for process improvement."
"Through data collection and analysis, it was found that the most significant defects were attributed to ‘yarn breaks’ and ‘pack changes’."
"After using the Fishbone Diagram and brainstorming, it was discovered that the main causes of yarn breaks were related to blockages in the Exhaust Monomer tube, Godet Roller, and Yarn Path."
"This issue was addressed by refining work instructions, creating inspection sheets, and scheduling regular checks on the Godet Roller."
The main reasons for pack changes were found to be the lack of work instructions and the incorrect assembly of the polymer filter following standards.
"This issue was addressed by reducing the duration of work processes, implementing work instructions, and using Factorial experimental design setups to determine the optimal interval for pack changes."
"As a result of these improvements, the defect percentage decreased from 6.51% to 5.84%, resulting in an annual cost reduction of 199,800 baht and the potential extension of the improvement methods to other departments."
