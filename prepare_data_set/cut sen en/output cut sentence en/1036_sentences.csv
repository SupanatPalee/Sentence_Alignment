The aim of this research was to study the optimum duration of blood storage while waiting for analysis without resulting in false-positive value.
"The technique used to measure zinc in plasma was Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), which is used to analyze heavy metal with small quantities."
The results of the research were found that the optimum duration to store plasma was 1-3 days when the result of the analysis was in the reference range as a biomarker for the assessment of zinc exposure risk at 551-925 ug/L and there was no hemolysis occurrence.
"For the 5 to 7 days of storage duration, it was found that there was partial hemolysis and the analysis result was higher even it was still in the reference range of Biomarker."
"This can be verified that the tendency of zinc level in blood is higher when the storage duration is increased, and it also causes more hemolysis occurrence."
It also influences the result of zinc analysis in plasma to be false-positive.
