This research aims to reduce aircraft â€˜s engine transferring time of case study company A.
"There is technical department in the company, which core competencies are repairing and maintenance passenger aircraft fleet."
This work applies motion and time study for determining the operation standard time and uses cause and effect diagram for identifying the root cause of the long engine transferring time.
"In deep analysis of time study, the data reveals that preparing hi-lifting jack process is main problem because it takes the longest processing time and lot of work force that causes technicians to become fatigue."
"Hence, this research applies Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange and Simplify concept (ECRS) and design theory to develop auxiliary equipment for engine transferring operation."
"Next, the proposed equipment is tested in real operation."
The results indicate that the proposed equipment can be applied efficiently for this process and reduced the engine transferring time significantly from 125 minutes (before improvement) to 73 minutes (after improvement).
