"This research aims to reduce waste production and increase the efficiency of the Khabao Silk Weaving: Â a case study of a community enterprise at BAN Pa-Ao, in Ubon Ratchathani."
"From a case study, it was found that there are 7 main activities in the silk weaving process."
The researcher uses a Flow Process Chart to study the steps in each production process.
"We found a problem in the Silk Reeling activity and Silk Spindle activity which the analysis of problems in the manufacturing process with 5W1H and the Why-Why Analysis shows the relationship between problems and all possible causes, including 7 wastes."
"It was found that there were many problems from the work process, how it worked complicatedly and the time spent working was a lot."
The study's work improvement technique (ECRS) was applied to design the corrective action was to create tools for Silk Reeling activity and Silk Spindle activity by designing tools from the actual work processes of the employees.
"The results obtained from the testing of the tools were that Silk Reeling machine can increase the production capacity from 1,000 grams per day to 2,000 grams per day, accounting for 100% of the production capacity and reducing the number of employees from the original need of 2 people to 1 person."
"In addition, it was found that the satisfaction assessment of Ban Pa Ao community enterprises in using the machine was at a good level."
"As for the results obtained from the experiment using the Silk Spindle device, it was found that before improving the process of weaving, labor was used to silk from Kong, moving from left and to right, around 200 grams of silk, takes about 70 minutes."
"After renovation by using a winch or finding that no labor was required to 200 grams of silk, takes about 40 minutes."
"The cycle time efficiency is 42.86% better than before, reducing the waste of waiting time."
