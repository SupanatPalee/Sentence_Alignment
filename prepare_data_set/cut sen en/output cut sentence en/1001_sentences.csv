"At present, the molding of the Super-Anglo stoves, also known as high efficiency cooking stoves, are molded by hand."
"Also, the problem found is that the standard of the furnace size is not stable, affecting the assembly of various parts of the furnace, and the villagers or farmers are fatigued and become myositis."
"In addition, they are not able to produce the stoves to meet the market demand."
"For that reason, this research aimed to study the performance of the Super-Anglo molding machine."
"The Super-Anglo molding machine consisted of a structure made of steel, the parts of the male mold and the female mold made of aluminum alloy, the part of the air pressure generating set with accessories, and the operation control section."
"The air pressure used in the study consisted of 6 bar, 7 bar and 8 bar."
"The criteria used to assess the performance of the Super-Anglo molding machine were the percentage of forming error, Super-Anglo stove production rate, specific energy consumption, thermal efficiency of stove and compression pressure resistance."
The results can be summarized as follows.
"First, compression pressure resistance affected the performance of the Super-Anglo molding machine."
"Second, the performance of the Super-Anglo molding machine in case of compression pressure was 8 bar higher than 7 bar and 6 bar."
"Third, percentage of forming error in case of compression pressure was 8 bar, below 7 bar and 6 bar, on average about 92.75% and 96.71%, respectively."
"Fourth, the production rate of Super-Anglo stove in case of compression pressure was 8 bar, about 25% and 66.67 higher than 7 bar and 6 bar, respectively."
"Fifth, specific energy consumption in case of compression pressure was 8 bar, less than 7 bar and 6 bar, average about 10.30% and 22.91%."
"Sixth, thermal efficiency of Super-Anglo stove in case of compression pressure was 8 bar greater than 7 bar, 6. bar and hand molding on average, about 2.74%, 5.58% and 15.77%, respectively, and finally, the compression pressure resistance of the wall in case of compression pressure was 8 bar, rather than 7 bar, 6 bar and hand molding, on average, about 7.54%, 16.77% and 31.46%, respectively."
