This study investigated the feasibility of using silane crosslinking technology to improve mechanical properties of polyoxymethylene (POM).
"The study determined effects of the amount of crosslink agent (1, 3, and 5) parts per 100 and Sauna incubation Period (0, 24, 72, and 120 hours) in the crosslink process which affected the mechanical properties of polyoxymethylene using statistics process."
Results from mechanical property tests and statistical analysis showed that the grafting reactions from the factor of crosslink agent had significantly higher influence on the mechanic properties of polyoxymethylene than had the factor of Sauna Period.
Increasing the amount of crosslink agent resulted in higher modulus of elasticity and hardness.
"However, the melting index was lower due to the higher chain grafting reaction."
"Increasing the Sauna Period increased the tensile and modulus elasticity properties of the polyoxymethylene, but reduced the percent elongation."
The investigation of morphology of cracks using scanning electron microscope revealed the effects of both factors on the mechanical properties of polyoxymethylene.
"Finally, polyoxymethylene which was added with one percent crosslink agent and the 24-hour Sauna Period had similar hardness and modulus elasticity properties, but with higher tensile and percent elongation properties."
