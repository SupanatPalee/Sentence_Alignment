The purpose of this research is to study the walking model of gait training for Children with Cerebral Palsy.
The proportions of the walking mechanism are considered according to the ergonomic principles of the physiology of Thai children in the age of 3 – 12 years old.
The principle of movement of the four – bar linkages to finding the step length is also considered.
"The walking model, which has been used to build a prototype of stationary gait training, is a device that helps Physiotherapists to perform physical therapy for Children with Cerebral Palsy."
The result shows that the maximum step length of this mechanism is 133.129 millimeters.
"In addition, it is found that the distance used for gait training also depends upon the speed chosen for training."
