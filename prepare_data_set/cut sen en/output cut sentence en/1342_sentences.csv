This paper presents the transceiver design of LED-based visible light communication system at the range of 7 meters.
Dimensions of transceiver box are of 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 6 cm.
This box consists of a light transmission controller module with development board: Arduino Nano V3.0.
The transmitter consists of a LED-based driver circuit.
The receiver consists of a TEMT6000 ambient light sensor module and a LM358 power amplifier.
Types of used files are text and image files.
The experiments are included with light transmission program with Visual Studio C # software.
Experimented and installed in a wide area without any obstructions during data transmission is used.
"Results of experiment show that the transmitted light data are sent at 50, 100, 150 and 200 cm."
"At the distance of 200 cm, the received data is distorted for image file."
It can be concluded that the received data will cause more distortion when the distance is more than 200 cm.
