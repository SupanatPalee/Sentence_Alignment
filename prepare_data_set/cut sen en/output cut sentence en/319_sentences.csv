This research presents the design and analyze of turbulence flow fields in agitation tank for comparison result by pitch blade turbine and curved blade turbine model.
In this research used the external flow for flow field analyzed in agitation tank.
The result show that the resultant turbulence was numerically predicted using computational fluid dynamics technique.
Turbulence model were developed in commercial software of fluid dynamic simulation for solve using the NAVIER-Stokes and K-epsilon turbulent model.
The rotation region for in this research using Local region (Sliding) approach was used to simulate the agitation blade turbine action in the vertical plane of the agitation tank.
Velocity profile generated from the numerical simulations were used to predict and compare the performance of the two designs.
To validate the CFD model.
The simulation results revealed that the CFD Simulation of curved blade turbine model can be the shortest mixing time when compare with pitch blade turbine.
