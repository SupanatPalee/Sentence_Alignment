The standard fire protection in buildings is regulated by the government.
The internationally used standard is the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).
The standard NFPA 20 and NFPA 25 indicated the use of fire pump in the system.
"Since the fire pump is not regularly used, therefore the pump performance may not be up to the working standard."
"In order to keep the pump to be in good condition, the NFPA required every building to perform their pumps testing periodically."
"Due to inexperience personals and lack of instrument, the fire pump testing procedure took a considerable long time to obtain the performance testing result."
This paper presented an automated fire pump performance testing system.
"A laboratory-scale system was constructed and test.The presented system shown to improve the testing time, accurate of testing result and permit the building to perform the test more frequent than required."
