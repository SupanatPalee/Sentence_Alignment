"The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of carbonized temperature, ranging from 300 to 500°C, and glycerin content, in ratios of 0, 20, 40, and 60% of weight, on the physical and thermal properties of briquette fuel made from sago palm residue."
"It was found that the physical properties, in terms of shatter index and durability, were enhanced when both the carbonized temperature and glycerin content increased."
"Moreover, the carbonized temperature and glycerin content directly affected the carbon content of the briquette fuel."
"Improvement of the thermal property, in relation to the heating value, resulted from increased carbon content."
The heating value increased as the carbon content increased due to its combustible component giving energy during the combustion process.
"It was found that the optimum carbonized temperature for converting sago palm residue to briquette fuel was at 400°C, whilst the optimum glycerin content for briquette fuel producing the best physical and thermal properties was at 60% weight."
