The objectives of this research were: 1) to design and build a pattern burner on a wood surface using electric heat; and 2) to test the efficiency of the pattern burner on a wood surface using electric heat.
The instrument used to research patterns on wood surfaces using heat from electricity was a satisfaction assessment form.
The results showed that the pattern burner on a wood surface using electric heat can write patterns well on bamboo and softwood at temperatures of 103 - 130 degrees Celsius.
Assessment by 5 experts on the tool to determine the quality of the workpiece was 4.02 with S.D.
0.34.
The evaluation results from the experts showed that the tool created by the researcher had a good performance.
