"Automated manufacturing technology assumes a pivotal role within the framework of Industry 4.0, enhancing productivity, adaptability, precision, and cost-efficiency."
"Particularly notable is its application in streamlining repetitive tasks such as product sorting, where robotic arms increasingly substitute human labor."
"Simultaneously, the integration of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems with automation enhances monitoring, control, and data aggregation capacities within production environments."
"This article aims to integrate an automated workpiece conveying and sorting system with a workpiece feeding mechanism, employing conveyor belts, robotic arms, IIoT systems, and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)."
It integrates the utilization of the robot arm and industrial-grade control apparatus with a workpiece feeding mechanism driven by an embedded Arduino microcontroller.
"The evaluation of the synchronization system between the workpiece feeding mechanism, conveyor belt, and robot arm for organizing six cylindrical workpieces onto a pallet, positioned in three rows, was conducted by activating the system via a push-button switch and a cloud-based SCADA system."
"It was determined that the system functioned as intended, achieving an average process cycle time reduction from 116 seconds to 98 seconds, and the average maximum position error in the x and y axes when placing the object was 0.1 mm, with the robot arm speed increased from 25 percent to 50 percent."
