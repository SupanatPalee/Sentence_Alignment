"In this research, Influence of temperature and time in surface hardening on plasma nitriding of blue head steel."
Objectives to study the chemical composition microstructure and surface hardness of blue head steel before and after plasma nitriding treatment.
Steel used in the experiment is a blue head steel so bought in the amount of 10 companies and stores that sell it.
The results of a study on the chemical composition of blue head steel classified as low alloy steel (AISI 4140 or JIS SCM 440).
It has a microstructure of pearlite and ferrite.
After plasma nitriding treatment.
The microstructure of the outer surface is '- Compound (Fe4N) inner layer is fine pearlite and fine ferrite.
The result of surface hardness before plasma nitriding treatment is 230 HV.
"A result of good condition is sintering time 20 hour at 550 oC outer surface hardness measured 1,450 HV."
