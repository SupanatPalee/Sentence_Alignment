"This research aims to compare the efficiency of plywood cutting layout creation using heuristic methods, between non-rotating and 90-degree rotating piece approaches for DIY furniture production."
The CutLogic 2D program was utilized to plan and create guillotine cutting layouts.
"The study employed 11 DIY furniture designs, each consisting of 1-10 sets, with pieces of various rectangular and square shapes."
"Plywood sheets measuring 1,219x2,438x15 millimeters were used to minimize material waste."
"The results showed that the 90-degree rotating piece heuristic method yielded an average total yield percentage of 83.28%, while the non-rotating method averaged 82.75%."
This demonstrates that the rotating piece method can increase the total yield by an average of 0.53%.
"Additionally, it helped reduce wood dust by an average of 0.104 kilograms."
These findings indicate simultaneous improvements in material utilization efficiency and reduction of environmental impact.
