The aims of this qualitative research were 1) to study ancient Khmer art history and hand-woven silk groups in Surin; 2) to use technology to help design silk patterns in ancient almanac; and 3) to discover the efficiency of ancient almanac silk pattern prototypes.
The sample group was selected using purposive sampling.
"The first design development group consisted of the Ban Dan Charoen Silk Weaving Group, Krathiam subdistrict, Sangkha district and the Ban Sai Women Weaving Group, Jaraphat subdistrict, Sikhoraphum district."
"The second group for discovering the silk prototype properties that have been developed consisted of the Ban Nong Bua Silk Weaving Women Group, Nong Bua subdistrict, Sikhoraphum district and the Ban Ten Mi Silk Weaving Group, Tenme subdistrict, Muang district."
"The research instruments consisted  of interviews, questionnaires, group discussions and participatory observation."
"The research findings showed that in Thailand there is distinct Khmer art in the Kingdom of Jenla, relating to architecture, religious places, and castles, such as Prasat Sikhoraphum (Ra Ngaeng Castle) built around the 17 century as a worship place in the Shaivism religion, with Buddhist influence from the Lan Chang Kingdom with architectural features that resemble a pagoda among the 5 elements."
This is one of the most beautiful and complete lintels in Thailand.
"In addition, the study of handwoven textiles in Surin Province found that most consist of mudmee fabrics."
"Moreover, in general, embroidering from the 2 to over 1,000 heddles, produced fabrics recognized internationally as high-class fabrics, such as the damask braid weaving silk and ancient almanac silk."
The sample group was satisfied with the ancient almanac silk format.
The silk pattern design technology used a graph table and computer design software consisting of a two - dimensional program.
The ancient almanac silk pattern prototype was effective according to Meguigan’s standard with a score of 1.012.
"Therefore, the computer technology for designing the ancient almanac silk pattern can be applied to the capability of the hand-woven silk group of Surin province."
