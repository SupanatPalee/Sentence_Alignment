This paper presents a mathematical model for solving the U-shaped assembly line balancing problem of type 1.
"The objectives of this study were to minimize the number of workstations, the cycle time of production and the precedence of tasks."
"The data set used in this study obtained from Armin Scholl (1993), totally 13 problems with 7-53 tasks, each with different cycle time."
The Lingo V.11.0 was used to find the optimal solution.
"It was found that this program could solve problems and provided less number of workstations for 7 problems, approximately 9%, compared to the results from Armin Scholl."
"Seventy-four problems, about 84%, had equal number of workstations and six problems, approximately 7%, could not be solved."
