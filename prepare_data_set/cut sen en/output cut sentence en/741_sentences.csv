This research is to study effect of heat recovery on performance of solar heat pump systems with greenhouse assisted for drying marine products.
A greenhouse effect was conducted as a heating source of the heat pump drying system.
The drying system were divided into two scenarios under the same condition including no ventilation heat recovery from the condenser room to the evaporator room (case 1) and the ventilation heat recovery from the condenser room to the evaporator room (case 2).
10 kg fresh mackerels (ripped at the back) with initial moisture content of 308 (%d.b.)
were set as samples.
"From the experimental results, it was found that the system with ventilation heat recovery had a higher drying performance than that without ventilation heat recovery."
The heat recovery system offered the final moisture content of 161.55 (%d.b.)
"with specific energy consumption (SEC) of 3.763 kWh/kg, specific electrical energy consumption (SEEC) of 1.375 kWh/kg and energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 4.792, respectively."
The ventilation heat recovery in the drying chamber was directly created a positive impact on the drying performance.
"Moreover, the ventilation heat recovery of heat pump drying could dehumidify the inlet air before flowing to the drying chamber (condenser room)."
The dried fish quality from both cases were similar to the typical sun-dried fish.
