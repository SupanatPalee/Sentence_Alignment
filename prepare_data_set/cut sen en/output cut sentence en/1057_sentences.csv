"After a satisfaction-evaluating form was constructed and used, it was found that the satisfaction in the model based on the 1950-1967 Volkswagen van was at the highest level for the aspect of strength( x ̅=4.55)."
The front of the 1950-1967 Volkswagen van is the V T1 whose turning signals were beside windshields.
