The purpose of this study was to build the milling machine for the leftover concrete from the construction industry by using the 3-tooth grinding gear with 25-cm width.
"The center of the gear is hexagonal, and its width is 2.5 inches and 2 niches."
"The shafts are put in alternating rows, 8 teeth each on both sides (16 teeth in total)."
"The motor in use has 1/5 horsepower, 220-volt electrical power (1 phase), speed 1,450 rpm."
"The results showed that the three selected types of the remaining from the construction: block bricks, mon bricks, and worm bricks, could be milled."
"To test the efficiency, the remaining bricks, 1 kg each, was milled."
Each type was tested five times.
The remaining of the milled bricks was used to find the overall mass ratio by sieving it through the No.4 sieve and the No.8 sieve to find the percentage of total mass by weight.
"The weight of the remaining of the block brick left on the No.4 sieve, the No.8 sieve, and the tray was 750.30 g (75.03%), 132.20 g (13.22%), and 125.70 g (12.57%), respectively."
It took 12.30 seconds to mill.
"The milled remaining was the coarse mass, 91.38%, and the fine mass, 8.71%."
The mon bricks could be milled and the remaining could sift through the No.4 sieve and the No.8 sieve.
"The weight of the remaining of the milled mon bricks on the No.4 sieve, the No.8 sieve, and the tray was 913.80 g (91.38%), 33.30 g (3.33%), and 53.84 g (5.384%), respectively."
It took 13.32 seconds to mill.
"The milled remaining was the coarse mass, 91.38%, and the fine mass, 8.71%."
Th worm bricks could be milled and the remaining could sift through the No.4 sieve and the No.8 sieve.
"The remaining of the milled mon bricks on the No.4 sieve, the No.8 sieve, and the tray was 727.00 g (72.70%), 123.30 g (12.33%), and 128.6 g (12.86%), respectively."
It took 13.55 seconds to mill.
"The milled remaining was the coarse mass, 72.70%, and the fine mass, 25.19%."
