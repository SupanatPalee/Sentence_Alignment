This research was studied the change of chemical composition of minimal medium (MM) and MM supplemented with green tea extract (GTMM) which were used to adapted  the probiotic strain  Lactobacillus plantarum before they were added to pomegranate juice.
The aim was to enhance viability of the microorganism in pomegranate juice which consisted of high acid and polyphenol compounds.
Determination the change of chemical compositions in the adapted solutions and in the probiotic supplemented pomegranate juice could be used to explain the survival of the cells.
"In the experiment, the treated cells were added into pomegranate juice and stored at 4 ºC for 14 days."
The results showed the highest survival cell number when the cells were treated with MM at pH 3.5 and the viable cells remained above 6 logCFU/ml for 3 days.
The study of the change of chemical composition in the adapted solution indicated that using GTMM as adapted solution reduced glucose consumption of the cell at 10 times compared to MM adapted cells and the cells consumed higher amount of glucose when they were adapted in acid conditions.
Evaluation of polyphenol compounds in pomegranate juice reviewed the higher consumption of catechin and p-coumalic by GTMM adapted L. plantarum compared to the MM adapted cells and this reduced the amount of healthy substances.
This research became the first study of the change of polyphenol compounds in pomegranate juice supplemented with probiotic cells which were adapted by different stress conditions.
It was found that preparation of the cells by the solution that composed with green tea extract did not increase cell viability in pomegranate juice but increased rate of consumption of some polyphenol compounds in the juice.
