"In the province Nakhon Pathom, there are a large number of pomelo peels."
Their peels are processed into incense or liquid soap and aromatic oils to provide an alternative to processing pomelo peels.
This research is about the possibility of processing pomelo peels into charcoal briquettes.
"In this study, the optimum blend ratio for briquettes is determined by comparing spontaneously heated compression and heater-heated compression, where the factors of heat, humidity, volatile content, ash and carbon constant were investigated."
The results showed that the charcoal was well compacted at a binder mix ratio of about 80% moisture.
"On the other hand, it was found that the higher or lower the moisture content of the charcoal, the more imperfectly it was compacted."
The results of the comparison between self-heating compression and heating compression were slightly different.
"However, when the two types of charcoal were dried in the sun, it was found that they dried equally well on the 5th day."
"The properties of charcoal briquettes made from pomelo peel show that the calorific value is more than 5,000 calories per gram."
The moisture content is between 8 and 11 per cent.
The volatile matter content is between 25 and 29 per cent.
The ash content is between 19 and 21 per cent and the stable carbon content is between 44 and 48 per cent.
"In summary, pomelo peels can be made into charcoal briquettes."
