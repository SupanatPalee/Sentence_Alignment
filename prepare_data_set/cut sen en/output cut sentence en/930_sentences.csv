This research designed a mixture of biomass to generate electricity using coconut husk mixed with wood chips.
"The biomass mixing model took 6 forms, with the proportion of mixing between coconut flakes and wood chips as follows: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1, 3:2 and 4:1."
Each model was tested for electricity production for a period of 24 hours.
"To analyze the return on investment and payback period, the results showed which of the 6 types of fuel mixture were able to generate sufficient heat and pressure to meet the demand for electricity."
The model 3 fuel mixture provided the maximum heat energy with fuel that can be sold at a level of 68.07%.
The use of 1 part coconut husk and 3 parts wood chips increases the cost of fuel leading to a difference in fuel cost and electricity that can be sold.
"When calculating the costs and analyzing the economic value, the researcher determined that model 4 has a return on investment (B / C) of 1.33, with a payback period of 3.93 years."
"Therefore, the proportion of coconut husk and wood chips (model 2:1) is considered to be the most appropriate."
