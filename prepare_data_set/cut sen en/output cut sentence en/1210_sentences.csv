The usage of lightweight concrete has been used in many construction works.
"As thehigher consumption of construction work, the amount of debris of lightweight concreteincreases with the works due to process of production, storage, and transportation."
Thesebroken lightweight concrete became construction wastes.
"Therefore, the study of reusingthese debris was conducted by mixing with Type I Portland Cement in ratio 1:1, 1:1.5,1:2, 1:2.5, and 1:3, respectively, at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days curing."
"The tests were carriedout all the samples for compressive strength, water absorption, and flexural strength.The result indicated that lightweight concrete mixed with Portland cement at 28 days hasvalued in accordance to TIS 2601-2556."
"At ratio 1:1 of external wall works and ratio 1:2.5of internal wall works, the price is cheaper than lightweight concrete brick ฿30.15/sq."
m.and ฿104.12/sq.
"m., respectively (exclude the crushing of lightweight aggregate work).Reusing of lightweight aggregate have a significant part to environment and a great wayto eliminate construction waste."
