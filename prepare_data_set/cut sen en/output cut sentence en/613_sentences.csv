This research presents the controller design of LEDs intensity using the adaptive TABU search.
The aim of the research is the control the LEDs intensity within the response as fast as possible.
The mathematical model of the proposed system derived from the generalized state – space averaging technique was used as the objective function for the adaptive TABU search algorithm.
The results show that the LEDs intensity response is better than the response using the controller designed by the conventional method.
"Moreover, the simulation and experimental results were used to validate the efficiency of the proposed controller design algorithm."
