The objectives of this study are to: 1) design multipurpose furniture from leftover car parts for residences with limited space; 2) evaluate the satisfaction of the target group for the mentioned design and use it as a guideline for designing furniture from waste car parts and providing users with comfort and more space preserved for work.
"Before designing, the researchers first inquired about the target group's needs for furniture in a limited space."
"The first five multipurpose pieces of furniture that the target group requested included tableaus, shelves, dressing tables, dining tables, and ironing boards."
"Next, the researchers designed product sketches with the concept of three types of campervans: type A: a fifth-wheel trailer; type B: a compact car teardrop trailer; and type C: a class C motorhome."
"The results of the design assessed by experts were of the same opinion and revealed that type A had the highest mean, Â = 2.86, S.D."
0.57.
The researcher then took type A to build the prototype product and assessed consumer satisfaction using a purposive questionnaire.
"The results found that the mean values of function, usability, beauty, strength, and materials were equivalent at a high level."
The summarized analysis results of the satisfaction assessment of consumers and those involved in the design of multipurpose furniture from leftover car parts for residences with limited spaces were at a high level.
