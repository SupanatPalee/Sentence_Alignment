Development of fuel cell system for convenient applications such as portable electricalsupplies is necessary.
"An air-breathing direct ethanol fuel cell, DEFC, is proposed over a closedair DEFC because this fuel cell does not require high pressure air feeding."
"Moreover, ethanolwhich can be obtained from agricultural product is also used as fuel in this system."
"In this work,comparisons of performances of air-breathing and closed air DEFC’s were carried out."
Fuel cellsof 50 cm2 active area with Nafion 112 membrane and 0.4 mg/cm2 of Pt/C catalyst loading on both anode and cathode sides were fabricated and experimentally tested.
"The results showedthat the air-breathing fuel cell, which eliminatepower consumptionby auxiliary devices,providesslightly lower power density than the closed air one."
"The effects of key operating parameterson air-breathing DEFC performance were ethanol solution concentration, anode ethanol solutionflow rate and temperatures."
"The testing show that the best fuel cell performance was resultedusing an ethanol solution concentration of 0.1 M, an anode ethanol flow rate of 80 ml/min, anda temperature of 85 ⁰C."
A maximum power density of 1.38 mW/cm2 and current density of4.62 mA/cm2 at 0.3 volt are obtained.
