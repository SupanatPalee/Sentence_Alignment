"The energy management system in Thailand has not specified guidelines for the designated factory to monitor the results of energy conservation measures determined in each year, but the laws require the energy management working group to monitor progress every year."
The objective of the research is to develop methods in monitoring the results from energy conservation measures for reviewing the achievement of energy conservation plan.
"In this work, the control charts for individual observations and moving ranges (X-MR control charts) were used to examine and analyze the specific energy consumption values from each year."
The criterion used in determining the achievement of measures was the occurrence of the patterns in the control charts.
The analyzed result of control charts showed that the measures to significantly reduce energy consumption should reveal the run pattern or trend pattern.
