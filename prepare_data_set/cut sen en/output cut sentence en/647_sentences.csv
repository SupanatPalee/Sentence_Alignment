The objective of this research is to study the drying of shiitake mushrooms by infrared-vacuum technique.
"Specific energy consumption, effective diffusion coefficient and suitable mathematical models to predict the drying kinetics of shiitake mushrooms were investigated under the drying conditions with the drying temperature of 50, 60, and 70 oC and the absolute pressure in drying chamber at 10, 15, and 20 kPa."
"The results showed that, the increment of the temperature or the reduction of absolute pressure in the drying chamber, the drying rate was high and low specific energy consumption."
Effective moisture diffusivity ranged from1.77x10-9 to 2.685x10-9 m2/s with increasing values according to higher drying temperature and lower absolute pressure in drying chamber.
"Midilli mathematical model gave the most appropriate predictions due to the highest coefficient of determination (R2=0.99689), the lowest root mean square error (RMSE=0.18370) and chi square (c2=0.00021)."
