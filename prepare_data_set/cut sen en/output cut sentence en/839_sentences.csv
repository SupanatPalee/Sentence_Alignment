"This research aims to study the elastic modulus of the recycled polyoxymethylene by adding silane coupling agent, blended and molded by twin screw extruder with injection molding process."
"By using the recycled polyoxymethylene add silane (VTMS) at 0, 1, 3 and 5 phr and add 0, 24, 72 and 120 hours of steam."
The study used modulus analysis for research elastic property.
These factors have the effect of decreasing modulus of elasticity.
"However, the 3 phr silane addition and the 0 phr of steam, the modulus of elasticity was highest at 1,089.40 MPa."
The statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed the influence of the steam and r-Pom fraction affecting to the Young’s modulus at the confident level 95%
