Growing lotus has been promoted in Thailand particularly in flooded areas where other plants cannot be grown.
Lotus seeds can be processed as OTOP product of the provinces with lotus planting areas.
This research attempted to design and fabricate a prototype lotus seed shell peeling machine to minimize the time and labor requirement in the fresh lotus seed shell removal.
"This prototype peeler consists of the main frame, cutting blade unit, Scotch Yoke mechanism, the power transmission unit and a prime mover by 90w-gear-motor."
The operation started with manually feeding lotus seeds into chute at the top of machine.
"Then they were conveyed to blade unit to cut lotus peel in diametrical axis by Scotch Yoke mechanism, and finally seeds were released through outlet chute at the bottom."
"The results revealed that the average speed of blade 7 m/min worked well among the average speed of blades 6, 7 and 8 m/min respectively."
The peeling percentage was 79% without any seed damage with working capacity of 3.6 kg/hr consuming 0.06 kW-hr of energy.
"An engineering economic analysis showed that it cost an average of THB 12.2 per kilogram at 1,440 hours per year with 3.4-month payback and 102.4 hours per year for break-even point."
This prototype can work at least twice as fast as human labor.
