Efficient mixing is required in various industries to require homogeneity and system consistency.
DC motor speed control is important for mixing processes.
"In this study, proportional integral (PI) controllers and proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers with simple first order filters designed in MATLAB/Simulink are compared using three different tuning methods such as Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) step response, Chien-Hrones-Reswick (CHR) step response and Closed-loop Pole placement design methods."
The purpose of DC motor speed control is to respond quickly without overshoot to prevent damage to the DC motor.
"Therefore, Kalman filter is considered to eliminate the occurrence of excessive overshoot."
The motor output signal is detected by an encoder and is then converted to revolutions per minute unit (rpm) before going through the noise reduction and the controller respectively.
The motor input is a pulse width modulation (PWM) cycle signal which is set in the range of 0-255.
Experimental results show that the Kalman filter is excellent in all cases the noise and excessive overshoot of the DC motor speed.
It can also accurately assess its state and can be used to reduce the aggressiveness of DC motor responses.
The DC motor speed control performance of the controllers based three different tuning methods are also compared.
It found that the PID controller based pole placement tuning method with the Kalman filter provide the most efficient response without overshoot for all desired speed values.
"The objective of this research titled vehicle routing by using a saving algorithm: a case study of community drinking water factory of Khok Chan Subdistrict, Utumpornpisai District, Sisaket Province was to compare the current vehicle routing with vehicle routing by using a saving algorithm (SA)."
The problems found in this factory were a lack of full vehicle capacity and the experience of staffs was the main decision to choose the transport routes.
"As a result, there is a lack of transportation efficiency."
"In this study, capacity constraints of transport vehicles had been taken into consideration."
The result found that using Saving Algorithm (SA) method could reduce the distance by 14.1 kilometers (total distance from 118.7 kilometers to 104.6 kilometers) or 11.88%.
"As a result, fuel costs were decreased by 47.94 baht per day."
"This represented a fuel cost savings of 1,438.2 baht per month."
"From the results of this research, it can be concluded that the saving algorithm method makes this transportation more efficient."
