"This research used Computer-aided engineering (CAE) to help adjust the initial injection parameters of polypropylene plastic material (Polypropylene; PP) to analyze injection pressure, clamping force, cooling system design and so on in order to adjust the efficiency of parameters before starting the injection process."
"The experimental results showed that the injection parameters obtained from CAE compared with the actual injection machine settings were as follows: injection pressure decreased by 0.4%, holding pressure increased by 1.38%, clamping force increased by 8.89%, and plastic mass increased by 58.06% and injection time increased by 50%."
"Therefore, this research experiment can reduce the time of the injection parameter adjustment process which is a time-consuming primary process and can be applied to other injection molding applications."
