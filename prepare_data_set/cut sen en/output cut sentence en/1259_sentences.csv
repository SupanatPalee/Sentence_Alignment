The turbulence models are only valid in the turbulence flow which fully developed.
"Near walls, the turbulence Reynolds number is low and turbulence models do not perform well."
The wall functions can be used to model the near wall region efficiently.
"The two-equation turbulence models compose of , , , and  models in OpenFOAM which is the open source software without the license cost and opening to edit codes had been applied with the wall functions for the flow validation."
The 3-D lid-driven cavity flow models by turbulence models were developed to compare with the experiment.
The wall function was applied on walls of the cell structure of each flow model.
The comparison shown that the  model with the wall function of viscous sub-layer () could represent flow behaviour inside the 3-D lid-driven cavity models correctly with the experimental results.
