This paper proposes application for calibrating the light source using the LabVIEW program.
A LabVIEW program is used for controlling parameters of optical measuring system (OMS-100).
"This program allows us to analyze the relative error and display the relation between the relative error and time, according to the consideration for standard criterion of light source equipment."
"Obviously, our system can obtain the high performance and reduce the error of the calibration."
