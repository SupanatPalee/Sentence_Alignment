This research aims to use cow feces from dairy farms as an aggregate of interlocking bricks.
The cow feces were obtained from the separator process.
The dry cow feces passing sieve No 4 were among the ingredients in concrete which serves as a guideline in producing interlocking bricks as community products.
The mixture consisted of concrete and fine sand in a ratio of 1: 7 by volume.
"Fine sand has been replaced by 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 parts of dairy waste, respectively."
All the mixing used 350 ml of water.
A concrete cube specimen was 10 x 10 x 10 cm in dimension.
"The moisture content, water absorption, and density were investigated at 28 days."
"The compression strength was studied at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days."
The results showed that the compressive strength and density reduces with increasing cow feces.
The moisture content and absorption of the sample tend to increase.
"The interlocking bricks with size 22.5 x 11.5 x 6 cm were chosen from the concrete mix proportion as fine sand to cow feces waste equals 1: 6.5 : 0.5 The moisture content, water absorption and density of interlocking bricks were also investigated within 28 days."
"The interlocking brick is in accordance with TCPS 602, and can be used as building materials."
