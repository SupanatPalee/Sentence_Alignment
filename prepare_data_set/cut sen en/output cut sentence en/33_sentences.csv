"The purpose of the study is to improve factory’s layout and production process, leading to the more effective processes of downlight lamp and to reduce cost."
"Because of the long distance and duration of transferring materials, the bottleneck process caused the delay."
"The study covers the analysis of the sample factory’s need and problems, using systematic layout planning, collecting fundamental information of each department such as duration and distance for transferring materials, cycle of customers’ needs for balancing assembly line, designing and setting out the factory, and adjusting the process and balance of assembly lines."
The consequences of improving the factory reveal the reduced distance in transferring materials by 33 meters or 27.04% and the reduced duration by 43 minutes or 24.57% accordingly.
"Moreover, the results of improvement in balancing assembly line by using ECRS show the reduction of cycle time in assembly lines by 64.08 seconds to 61.36 seconds, total of reduced cycle time is 2.7 seconds or 4.24%."
"The productivity has been increased from 2,234 to 3,037 per day."
The total increased output is 803 pieces or 35.94% per day and reduce 2 from 10 workers or 25%.
These lead to the ability of the factory to support the increasing purchased orders from customers in the future properly.
