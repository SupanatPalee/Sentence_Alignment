Corbel is a structural member which is generally used in building construction especially in precast systems.
Reactive powder concrete (RPC) is a new type of ultra-high strength concrete having high mechanical properties and durability and no design standard.
This research aims to study the behavior of RPC corbels without stirrups under increasing vertical loading until failure.
The shear span-to-depth ratio (av/d) of the corbels was 1.0.
"From the test results, it was found that the load carrying capacity of the RPC corbels exhibit ductile behavior."
No sudden failure occurred even though the corbels had no stirrups.
"In addition, the failure characteristics of the corbels and the analysis of the test results using strut-and-tie model are also reported in this paper."
