The purpose of this study were 1) to analyse soils in 11 districts of Kampangphet Province.
2) to test the effectiveness of soil in 11 districts of Kampangphet Province.
3) to evaluate the users of using sphere products of flower plants and garden trees in 11 districts of Kampangphet Province.4)to transfer the production process of sphere pottery that used for inhibiting the evaporation in flower plants and garden trees that grew in gardening flowerpot in 11 districts of Kampangphet Province.The researcher studied the raw materials of clay and tested by using bendind via for testing the shrinkage of toughness.
The research found that local caly sources in 11 districts in kamph aeng phet  province  whose properties are acidic  most sillca compounds phantom it is suitable 96.80 %  try to come down  golden sand 63.12 % and  thungsethi clay soil 63.10 % and   neutral properties   containing the most alumina compounds is  khlong khlung caly 27.01  %  lan krabue clay 24.70 % and thungsethi clay  21.52 % and  alkaline properties  with the highest  is  pang sila thong clay  9.10 %  sai ngam clay 6.46  % and  bueng samakkhi clay 8.82 %  physical properties  the contraction was the most is and  bueng samakkhi clay 9.41 % Followed by  lan krabue clay 8.82 % and  kosamphi clay 6.47  %  has the higest water absorption value is bueng samakkhi clay 21.21 %  try to come down  sai ngam clay  lan krabue  sai thong pattana  20.00 %  and  the most strength value  is rush clay 202.00 kg/cm3  try to come down  kosamkhon clay  151.25 kg/cm3   and  thung sethi clay 98.30 kg/cm3  and  when the technology transfer to the participants was 32.31 % and  worth (S.D.=19.58) value  (t-test = 34.66)  at the same time .05
