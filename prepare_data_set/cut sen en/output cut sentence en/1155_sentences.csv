The protein-containing wastewater acid-forming efficiency in an acidogenic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was investigated in this study.
"A synthetic wastewater used as an influent was represented the ice cream wastewater, the food supplements wastewater, and the cosmetic effluent with COD of about 2,000 mg/l."
"A 3-l CSTR operated continuously at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 hr, organic loading rate (OLR) in the range of 13.24-13.92 kg COD/m3.d under ambient temperature and non-pH adjustment condition."
The acidification efficiency and acid production rate of the cosmetic wastewater was 36.5% and 4.8 g COD/l.d respectively followed by the ice cream wastewater (30.2% and 3.9 g COD/l.d) and the food supplements effluent (10.8% and 1.4 g COD/l.d).
Biogas production was suppressed.
The operational conditions applied in this study are thus suitable for the acidification of protein-containing wastewater.
