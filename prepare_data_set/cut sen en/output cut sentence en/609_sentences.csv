"Nowadays, a kilowatt hour meter is often installed in a tilted manner."
It may cause the error of kilowatt hour meter.
The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of installation angle on the electrical energy measurement of the single phase kilowatt hour meter.
This research was carried out with an induction type kilowatt hour meter with a rated current of 5(15) A single phase and adjusted the installation angle in the face down and sideways by adjusted 50 increment from 00 to 900 by constant electric energy.
"The results were found that if installation angle are increase, the turntable of the induction type kilowatt hour meter will be more slowly even though there are different power factor values but the electric energy remains the same."
The results obtained were not significantly different.
"But, the effect of installation angle of the induction type kilowatt hour meter will be more if current and quality of the induction type kilowatt hour meter is low."
"Therefore, this research will be important information in considering the improvement of the operating process in order to achieve fairness in buying-selling electricity between Provincial Electricity Authority and electricity (PEA) users and it is for policy to reduce the electricity loss of PEA."
