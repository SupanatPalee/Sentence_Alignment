This research aims to study the chloride penetration resistance and compressive strength of concrete with recycled concrete aggregate (RCA).
"The RCA was used to replace the coarse aggregate at the percentage replacement of 10%, 25%, 50% and 100 %."
Fly ash (FA) was used as a partial binder replacement material at the percentage replacement of 20% and 30%.
"While, limestone powder (LP) was used to replace the binder at the percentage replacement of 10%."
"The water to binder ratios (w/b) were kept at the ratios of 0.40, 0.50 and 0.60."
"The rapid chloride penetration resistance, bulk chloride diffusion resistance and compressive strength of the concrete with RCA were conducted."
"Based on the experimental results, it was found that the chloride penetration resistance and compressive strength of concrete reduced with the increase of w/b and RCA amount."
"While, the chloride penetration resistance and compressive strength of concrete increased when the water curing was increased."
"Besides, the utilization of only FA could increase the chloride penetration resistance and compressive strength of concrete with RCA better than concrete with FA and LP."
