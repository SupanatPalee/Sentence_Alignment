This paper presents the analysis of channel estimation with the weight least squares algorithm in the reverse-link data transmission for Multiuser-MIMO.
The weight least square algorithm is used for channel estimation method to compensate the signal distortion and to prevent the interference effect.
"The MIMO-based system has a higher spectrum efficiency during data transfer, which may interfere the original data with each other from the inserted external signal."
The weight least square algorithm is used for channel estimation method to compensate the signal distortion.
Experimental simulation results show that the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) obtained from the weighted least squares algorithm for the channel estimation in the reverse-link data transmission is higher than that of the conventional least squares method.
