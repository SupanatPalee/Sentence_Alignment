The aim of this paper is developing a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to control climate with evaporative cooling system in model of poultyr house.
"In recent year, many studys show that FLC has good performance and simple to apply with a complex system and poultry house climate control is nonlinear system which is complex and difficult to control."
Thus we apply FLC to control this system.
"By internal temperature and relative humidity, important index indicating thermal comfort, is feedback signal."
"In the design, 2 FLCs used for controlling fans and pump."
Both FLCs use the structure of 4 inputs and 1 output.
The error and the error derivative of temperature and relative humidity are the input of the system.
"These are translated to linguistic valuables by the membership function and through fuzzy processes according to If-Then rule which based on phase plane analysis to arrive at single value, and then defuzzification to get value of the change of ventilation rate and moisture production rate."
The maximum and average error is collected to propose FLC comparing with a conventional control system.
The result shows that FLC can control temperature in ± 1.5 °C range and relative humidity control in ± 20% range.
The FLC has better performance than a conventional system.
"For the future work , to improve relative humidity response the finer membership function should be apply."
