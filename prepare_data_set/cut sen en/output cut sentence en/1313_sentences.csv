"However, it is surprising that the uptake of precast construction method is still in its infancy in Cambodia."
"Thus, the goal of the research aims to investigate the factors impacting precast utilization in Cambodia construction industry by evaluating the significance of 5 benefits and 25 hindrances obtained from extensive literature reviews which impact the practitionerâ€™s perspectives via a closed-ended questionnaire of four different groups such as designers, manufacturers, deliverers, and assemblers."
"Consequently, this applied cross-sectional quantitative research found out top five significant factors in four main processes such as design, production, transportation and delivery of precast technology in Cambodia construction industry."
