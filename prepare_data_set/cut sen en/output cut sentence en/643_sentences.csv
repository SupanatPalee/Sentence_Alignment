This research aimed to study the release of riboflavin from composite hydrogel beads in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid.
"(SIF) The combinations of gel bead were 100% alginate, 62% alginate and 38% whey protein, 50% alginate and 50% whey protein, 62% alginate and 38% xanthan gum and 50% alginate and 50% xanthan gum."
"The cross linking solutions were mixtures of calcium chloride with 0%, 0.25% and 0.5% chitosan."
The result showed that 100% alginate beads elicited good forming with homogeneous size and shape.
Adding whey protein and xanthan gum to alginate improved riboflavin captivation and slow release.
"Comparison of fitting with 7 release models, release kinetics of the beads could be explained by Higuchi model, Korsmeyer-Peppas model, and Weibull model."
The release mechanism was governed by a combination of diffusion and bead erosion.
