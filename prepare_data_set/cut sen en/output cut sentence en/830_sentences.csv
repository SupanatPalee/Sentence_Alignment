This research aims to study the quality of production of small enterprise workers after applying knowledge management processes.
Case study of the sewing industry in Ubon Ratchathani province.
The sample group consisted of 50 employees working in the production of V-neck T-shirts in a sewing factory in Ubon Ratchathani province.
"After that, the production process was studied."
"Define the sample group at Control the experimental environment Apply knowledge management process Comparative study of control charts before and after application of knowledge management process The research found that Value of waste from work after knowledge management Decreased from normal work environment 14.55% Value of waste from work after knowledge management Have less distribution than normal environment Production quality of the knowledge management process More stable than before knowledge management But when testing the hypothesis by using t-test In conclusion, the work quality of the employees before and after knowledge management has different production quality at the 0.05 level of significance."
Thailand has promoted the generation of electricity using solar power renewable energy.
"However, the disposal of solar panels at the end of their life impacts on the environment, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions."
This research focused on an evaluation of greenhouse gas release in the processes of solar panel waste disposal.
"This study conducted a scenario analysis of expired solar panels located at the University of Phayao sent for disposal in Japan, and assessed the WEEE Directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) in the recycling process."
"Two processes were evaluated: the transportation and recycling of 250-watt, polycrystalline silicon solar cells, based on a product life cycle assessment."
The results found that the total greenhouse gas emission value was 8.6370 kgCO2eq/module- 2.1295 kgCO2eq/module from transportation and 6.5075 kgCO2eq/module from the recycling processes in Japan.
Establishing a recycling plant in Thailand will diminish the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.
"In addition, the use of renewable energy in electricity generation should be encouraged, as well as the selection of highly-efficient recycling technology to reduce the environmental impact."
