The objectives of this research were to determine the antimicrobial activity of hand cleansing gel mixed with water lily (Nymphaea lotus L.)extract.
"Petal and pollen of Nymphaea lotus L. were extracted with serial different solvent: hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol and water."
"Antibacterial activity of crude extracts from petals and pollen were preliminarily examined against bacteria using E.faecalis, E.Coli ATCC 25922 K. Pneumonia  P. Aeruginosa ATCC 27853 S. typhimurium, S. aureus ATCC 29213 S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 and V. cholerae by agar well diffusion method."
Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were tested by using broth dilution method.
The ethyl acetate extracts from petals and hexane extracts from pollen were the best to inhibit gastrointestinal bacteria.
"However, hand cleansing gel mixed the ethyl acetate extracts from petals inhibited all 4 strains bacteria; E. Coli ATCC 25922 S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 V. cholerae and S. aureus ATCC 29213."
Hexane extracts from pollen mixed hand cleansing gel only inhibited E. Coli ATCC 25922 S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 and V. cholerae but it not found inhibited  S. aureus ATCC 29213.
The results of this study revealed that the potential uses of the extracts of native medicinal plants can develop to hand cleansing gel for inhibiting pathogenic bacteria and uses as prevention for bacterial infections.
