This research aims to analyze the food-safety chain system.
"Initially, both quantitative and qualitative data of stakeholders are evaluated using the mixed methods research (MMR) technique for the case study of Ubon Ratchathani."
"The questionnaires were collected for four sample groups: farmers, distributor, wet marketâ€™s vendors, and consumers."
"Then, data are analyzed for three parts, which are satisfaction level, factors affecting the system of the food-safety chain, and open-ended questions."
"Analyzed results show that distributor, vendors, and consumers are similarly concerned with the transportation cost and the available number of logistics providers."
"Moreover, farmers and vendors are more concerned with product safety during the transportation, while consumers prefer the quality control during shipping."
"Next, relevant factors are synthesized using the causal loop diagram (CLD), in which the developed model is verified and validated with the provincial food-safety committee's representatives."
"In particular, the developed CLD consists of 9 loops, which are divided into 6 reinforcement loops (RL) and 3 balanced loops (BL)."
"In addition, analyzed results from CLD can be further extended for policy recommendations of food-safety chain."
"Given the loop of consumer choice, for example, relevant government agencies are suggested to implement regulations and strategies to promote safe-food manufacturers or entrepreneurs."
Such implementations can help to increase both the number and choice of safe-food consumers.
