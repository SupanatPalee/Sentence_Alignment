Manufacturing in today’s Glass Industry is rapidly changing as the result of the intense competition in the market nowadays.
The organizations will have to be continuously developed in order to improve the production especially in term of cost reduction and price to be more competitive in the world market.
This research aims to apply Lean Six Sigma for the production process improvement.
It consists of five basic phases.
The Define phase is the first phase of Lean Six Sigma.
"In this phase, a problem statement was set that was to reduce the percentage of non-conforming wine glass with non-flat at the bottom."
The next one is the Measure phase.
The precision and accuracy of the measurement system were analyzed.
The third phase is the Analysis phase.
"To investigate the root causes of the problem, the Physical phenomena – Mechanism Analysis was applied."
The following phase is the Improve phase.
The statistical techniques were used to determine the appropriate levels of the process parameters that lead to the minimum number of non-flat wine glass foot.
The fifth phase is the Control phase.
"To ensure the process being managed and monitored properly, the controlling methods was proposed."
"As shown in the results, the percentage of non-conforming products had been decreased from 3.20% to 1.73%, which it is even lower than the target set."
