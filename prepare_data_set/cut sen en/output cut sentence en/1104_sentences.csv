This paper describes the development of a trajectory control algorithm for a Para rubber tapping manipulator.
The trajectory was designed in accordance with an elliptical tapping cut.
A two-axis cartesian robot was used as a prototype of the tapping manipulator.
The objective of this study was to guide the manipulator in tracking the designed trajectory.
The experiment was conducted in a laboratory using a cylindrical model of Para rubber tree.
"The experimental results showed that the trajectory control employing a PID controller could help the manipulator to track the desired trajectory smoothly, even though maximum positional error inÂ  Z axis was 14.8 mm at the final position of movement."
"In conclusion, the developed trajectory control algorithm has a great potential in adaptability for practical use."
