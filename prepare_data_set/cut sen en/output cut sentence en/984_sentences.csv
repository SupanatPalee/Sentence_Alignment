The objective of this research was to study on drying kinetic of waterlily and their properties before and after drying.
A study was conducted on the drying of Colorata waterlily by silica sand landfill combined with vacuum and microwave technique.
"Waterlily were dried with microwave power of 400, 500 and 600 watts and absolute pressure inside the drying chamber at 5 kPa."
"The study found that higher microwave power results in lower moisture content of waterlily, reduced drying time and specific energy consumption."
"Whereas, the total color difference of waterlily is increased."
Waterlily were dried at an average initial moisture content of 756.06% d.b.
(dry basis) until reaching a final moisture content of 5.88% d.b.
at a microwave power of 600 watts had the least drying time of 80 minutes and lowest specific waste energy was 0.203 MJ/gevaporatedwater.
Only the desiccant drying techniques gave the lowest total color difference of waterlily of 5.22.
"Anyway, considering only the microwave drying found that waterlily drying by microwave power at 400 watts gave the lowest total color difference of 6.13."
"Moreover, all techniques of waterlily drying gave the water activity less than 0.6, which was within the standard."
