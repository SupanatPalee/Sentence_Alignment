Optimization of drinking water filling process: a case study of Thap Kaew drinking water plant Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University to increase productivity and reduce the loss of water in the packing process.
"According to the problem analysis with cause and effect diagram and Why - Why analysis, it was found that there was low productivity due to slow filling of drinking water because each step was not continuous as one employee had to fill the drinking water step by step."
"The improvement was achieved by increasing the workforce by requiring water supply department staff to assist with the filling process and re-establish the water delivery schedule without affecting water delivery, increasing productivity by 133.41%."
"The problem of water wastage found that there was overflow in filling and a lot of effluent from rinsing the bottle due to uneven water supply nozzles, manual valves and no rinsing process; clear work on the expertise of staff only."
"The solution is to adjust the water distribution head to be consistent, set clear work procedures and change the use of manual valves to use automatic water on-off machines."
"After improvement, it was found that the amount of wastewater was reduced by 3.1 liters/time."
