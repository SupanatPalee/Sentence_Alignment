This research aimed to investigate triclocarban (TCC) antibiotics removal efficiency comparison between Pseudomonas fluorescens MC46 and Ochrobactrum sp.
MC22.
The study was performed contaminant removal by microbes in both free and entrapped cell forms.
Barium alginate was chosen as an entrapment material.
The experiment included TCC removal and intermediate monitoring test and structural observation of entrapped cells using scanning electron microscope.
"The result showed that the entrapped cells had higher TCC removal performance than the free cells (removal efficiencies of up to 53 and 38, respectively)."
The TCC removal efficiencies by MC46 were slight better than those by MC22.
"Based on the intermediate monitoring, 3,4-dichloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline, and aniline were detected."
Both microbes well degraded TCC and   the three intermediates.
TCC was transformed to be less toxic substances.
"For micro-structural observation, the dense net matrix with microbial cells was found."
"After the application, numerous microbial cells grew in the material."
The result showed that the entrapment material promoted good environment for cell growth and protected cells form toxic substances resulting high TCC removal efficiencies.
