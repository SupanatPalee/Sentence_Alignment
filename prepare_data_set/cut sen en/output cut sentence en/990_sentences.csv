"The objective of this research was to study the performance of white noodle dryers with single-flow hot air with variations in drying temperature and hot air speed under drying temperature conditions of 45, 50 and 55 ֯C and wind speeds of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m/s."
"The moisture ratio, drying rates and specific energy consumption were tested to evaluate the performance of the dryers."
"The study found that in the case of a drying temperature of 55 ֯C and a hot air speed of 2 m/s, the lowest moisture ratio was 0.162, with the final white noodle moisture value being 15.83 %d.b."
"In other words, an average drying temperature increase of 10% caused a 9.83% decrease in the moisture ratio, and an increase in the average hot air speed of 40% caused a 6.76% decrease in the moisture ratio."
The maximum drying rate was 0.74 kg/h and the lowest specific energy consumption was 6.013 MJ/kg.
"In addition, a study of the kinetics of white noodle dryers with single-flow hot air was conducted compared with the results of the experiment."
"The two-term equation could best predict the effect of drying noodles with hot air, with R2 equal to 0.999023944, which was the largest value, and RMSE of 0.008964633, which was the smallest value."
"When the calculated value according to the format of the two-term equation was compared with the results obtained from the experiment, the results of these comparisons were found to be very consistent."
