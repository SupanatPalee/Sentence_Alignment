"This research aimed at creating knowledge management in renewable energy management to reduce the cost of the community's electricity system and increase the efficiency of renewable energy use of solar light with the community participation through the following activities; analyzing current electricity system and community demands, providing knowledge on renewable energy, and designing the productive maintenance that everyone could participate using the total productive maintenance (TPM) principle."
The guide of engaging preventive maintenance was created so that community could continue on its own and make full use solar farm to reduce the cost of the community's electricity in the long term.
"In addition, this could be a model for other communities or a guideline for decision making in renewable energy support for relevant work units as well."
