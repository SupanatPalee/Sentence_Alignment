"Nowadays, in industrial factories, automatic machines are increasingly used in the production process."
"With the main industry using automatic machinery such as the automotive industry, electronics industry Including, and the concrete products industry and is likely to be used in other industries, from the past to the present, Thailand still relies on imports of automatic machinery from foreign countries, which has a high value and is likely to increase."
"Continuously Which, the import of technology from abroad causes users to lack knowledge and understanding of correct use resulting in industrial automation machinery being damaged or prematurely damaged due to lack of proper maintenance."
"According to the study, there were frequent breakdowns in the automatic steel framing welding and automatic concrete compactors, which affected production."
"From the above problems and situations, this research aims to establish a maintenance system for automatic steel frame welding machines in a sample factory using the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) analysis."
"To develop a maintenance system that will be divided into structural sub-components Power, transmission equipment, Electrical equipment, and controls and support equipment."
"The maintenance of the system will be considered from the calculated risk by defining the strategy for the maintenance of the system into three parts: high risk, medium risk, and low risk."
"Strategic planning consists of autonomous maintenance, preventative maintenance, and corrective maintenance."
The results showed that 1) the number of stoppages of machinery for changing the welding set decreased to 75%.
"2) The number of disruption of machinery that requires more than one day of repair is reduced to 85% 3) Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) increased to 27%, and 4) Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) reduced to 45%."
