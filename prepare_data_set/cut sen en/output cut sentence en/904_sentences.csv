"The objective of this research is energy efficiency assessment of Lifelong Learning Institute Building, Chiang Rai Rajabhat University."
"Building structure data, lighting system, air conditioning system, and electrical equipment are investigated and are analyzed by Building Energy Code (BEC)."
"Then, these data are analyzed building improvement method for zero energy building."
"The evaluation result of building envelope system found that, the overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) is not meet standard, but Roof thermal transfer value (RTTV) is meet to standard."
"The parts of light system, air conditioning system and total energy consumption is meet the standard as the requirement of building energy code."
This research also study for energy efficiency building solution which are 2 conditions.
The condition 1 is efficiency increasing of building envelop by wall insulation adding and glass replacement to energy saving glass.
"It found that, the result of OTTV evaluation is meet the standard."
The condition 2 is renewable energy technology selection by 20 kWp solar roof top installation for electricity generation which has 100 unit per day of maximum power generation.
"It found that, this technology can produce enough electricity for Lifelong Learning Institute Building, Chiang Rai Rajabhat University."
It can make to net zero of building which can be a model of net zero energy building of Chiang Rai Rajabhat University and green university preparing.
