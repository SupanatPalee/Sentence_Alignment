The objective of this research is to study the replacement of Guardrail from recycled plastic.
It started by using a computer program Robot Structural Analysis to make a model of the guardrail.
It consists of various types of plastics as follows: 1) High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) 2) Low density polyethylene (LDPE) 3) Polypropylene (PP) 4) Polystyrene (PS) 5) Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) to analyze the guardrail performance.
"according to NCHRP 350 (TL-3) standard, the results of the program analysis showed that ABS and PS plastics had lower deformation values than other plastics."
"Therefore, both pairs of plastic were used to develop plastic forming with a Single Screw Extruder into a rectangular shape with dimensions of 1.0 m X 0.3 m X 0.01 m Total amount of 40 pieces were taken to test the Flexural Strength Test, found that The ABS type has an average Flexural Strength of 1.099 kN/mm, and the PS type has an average Flexural Strength of 0.672 kN/mm and the ABS + PS type has an average Flexural strength of 1.496 kN/mm The momentum test was performed with a pendulum with a mass of 101 kg The test speed was 20 km/h It was found that the ABS type had an average deflection distance of 86.99 mm The PS type had an average deflection distance of 57.08 mm and the ABS + PS type has an average deflection distance of 101.31 mm and able to redirect the pendulum to its original position after testing without breaking through the guardrail"
