Deep cycle lead-acid battery is a rechargeable battery whose service life depends on their capacity and working environment.
Battery capacity depends on active materials used as negative active materials.
"One major component that increases the performance of the active material is an expander which consists of barium sulfate, sodium lignosulfonate and carbon black."
"In this study, developments of a deep cycle lead-acid battery were investigated."
"Cyclic voltammetry, high discharge rate tester, transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope were used to investigate the capacity of the prepared negative electrode and to examine the structure of the expander."
The results showed that the two different types of carbon black influenced the structure of carbon network in an expander and resulted in the change of the amount of charge and charge transfer resistance.
All prepared expanders exhibited the higher amount of charge and lower charge transfer resistance than those of a commercial expander.
The high discharge test shows that the capacity of a battery using XE500-02 higher than that using a commercial expander.
The higher capacity is due to an increase of the surface area of negative active materials.
