This research article on predicts of electricity consumption by using ANN method.
It is intended to be a case study in planning to develop a suitable electric power management system in the future and to study and compare the results between measuring with measuring instruments and predict by ANN method.
"From the study in the sample educational institutions, namely, school A and school B."
The variables used consisted of the maximum power demand and the load factor.
using the data in the year 2014 in ANN system learning and data in 2016 2015 is used for testing the predict results.
The statistic used was the percentage error (%Error).
The results showed that A school had an error of 4.76% and School B had an error of 6.63%.
