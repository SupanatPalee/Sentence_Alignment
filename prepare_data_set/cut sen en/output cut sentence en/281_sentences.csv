The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of Lignite bottom ash blended with natural rubber on mechanical properties of concrete.
Mix design ratio of cement:sand:aggregate is used at 1:2:4 by volume.
"Lignite bottom ash was used to replace Portland cement of 0,10,15 and 20 percentage by weight."
Water to cement ratio is 0.6.
The natural-rubber ratio has been fixed at 7.5% by weight.
"To provide natural-rubber, the ammonia concentrate solution 15% concentration was added in to the natural-rubber at 3% by weight and in addition with 4 percent of nonionic surfactant is also used in the mixture."
Mechanical properties i.e.
"workability, compressive strength and flexural strength were then tested."
"The results showed that the natural rubber is added, workability, compressive strength is decreased while  flexural strength increased."
A mixture of 10 percent of Lignite bottom ash could enhance the compressive strength in the long-term.
"The flexural in LBA10 was higher than concrete control 60 days, compressive strength of LBA10 was 99.97 percent of concrete control."
