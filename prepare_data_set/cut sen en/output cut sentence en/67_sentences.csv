This research aims to develop and design the Lygodium wallet product by using of quality function deployment techniques with Kansei Engineering.
Exploring and converting customer needs into product purchase decisions.
The results were analyzed using the qualitative functional transformations in the product planning matrix.
It focuses on converting customer requirements into technical specifications.
"Kansei Engineering is therefore used to support further analysis of product design that conveys the emotions of the customer, which is an important part of product development."
"The results showed that product development in the qualitative functional conversion analysis section has changed from material, usability, quality, convenience, and cost."
In the first quantitative analysis section of Kansei Engineering has been changed product characteristics.
"The number 6 product features, namely size, style, style of bag, usage, color tone, and shape have been changed to make the product design that conveys creative emotions, simplicity, and outstanding interest."
"Therefore, for the development and design of Lygodium wallets, it was found that the customers were most satisfied with the characteristics of the weaving method as the priority."
"The level of satisfaction was at a very good level (Average= 4.50), along with the satisfaction of feeling simple."
The satisfaction level was very good (Average = 4.51).
