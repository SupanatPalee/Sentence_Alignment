This work is aimed at corrosion analysis of STBA12 superheat tube from bagasse-fuel biomass power plant.
"The results indicated that the fouling on tube surface composed of K2SO4, KCl and low-melting point eutectics compound such as KCl-K2SO4."
In service the tube surface temperature was in a range of 510-780 oC at which eutectics compound melted.
This high corrosive molten salt was a reactant for deterioration of steel superheat tube.
Cross-sectional investigation found the uniform iron oxide layer which was a product from high temperature oxidation reaction.
"Additionally localized corrosion attacks, sulfur attack (S-attack) and chlorine attack (Cl-attack), were observed."
"The S-attack was a superficial and sharp attack about 5-10 mm depth along grain boundaries; whereas, the Cl-attack was a deep attack about 20-50 mm depth along grain boundaries."
Source of chlorine was from molten salt and products of sulfation reaction such as chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrochloride (HCl)
