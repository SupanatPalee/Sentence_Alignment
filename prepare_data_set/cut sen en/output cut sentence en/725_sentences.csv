Evaluation of the effect of iron powder residue ratio on fly ash geopolymers and the influence of hot curing temperature.
"The alkali solution was controlled using a sodium hydroxide solution concentration of 8 molars, the ratio of sodium hydroxide to sodium silicate solution."
"(SS/SH) was 1.0, liquid to binder ratio by weight (L/B) was 0.45."
Controlled geopolymer (CGP) was determined in the study of fly ash geopolymers.
"Compared with the evaluation of waste iron powder geopolymers at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% wt."
fly ash ratios.
"Hot curing at 60°C for 24 h and temperature influence assessment at 20% waste iron powder ratio by hot curing at 30, 40, 50, and 60°C for 24 h. Waste iron powder residue ratio and temperature influence physical properties including time of setting and bulk density, mechanical properties including compressive strength, and flexural strength of samples aged 3, 7, and 28 days."
The setting time decreases as the waste iron powder ratio increases.
"As for the bulk density of the geopolymer samples mixed with waste iron powder, it was found that the bulk density increased with the ratio of iron powder residue."
"The higher the density of the sample, the more strength than the less dense sample."
"Compared to the control geopolymer samples, it was found that the compressive strength was reduced."
while the flexural strength is higher.
The geopolymer power decreases with more geopolymer age and higher curing temperatures.
"According to the study, the optimum heat curing temperature for geopolymers in the study was in the range of 50-60 °C."
The development of compressive strength and flexural strength tended to increase with the curing temperature.
"Up to the optimum temperature range, the strength of the iron powder slag geopolymer reaches its maximum value, when the temperature is above the appropriate range, the compressive strength and flexural strength tend to decrease."
