This research first studies the limitations of existing Bangkok rapid transit train ticket system.
Then we propose an analysis model using queuing theory to evaluate the impact of upgrading the existing ticket machine with respect to both the number and types of ticket machines.
"The proposed analysis model can be used to evaluate the service time of railway companies, which enables for the operators to form a proper policy and decide on different ticket system operations based on cost requirements."
ThisÂ analysis model has confirmed that the queuing theory model in four case studies of BTS (Bangkok Mass Transit System) and MRT (Metropolitan Rapid Transit) ticket machines are able to analyze or evaluate the impact of ticket system modification.
"Since, the proposed queuing theory model presents the results to show the impact of time delay in queue of passengers when ticket machines are modified by number or feature upgrading."
The proposed analysis model could potentially be used to any rapid transit train ticket system for impact evaluation on the existing ticket system.
