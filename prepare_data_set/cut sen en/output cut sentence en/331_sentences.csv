A design and mathematical modeling of a hydraulic pressure converter with a conventional hydraulic transformer working with a high-speed on-off valve is presented in this paper.
The goal of the research is to increase the load pressure range by utilizing the motor to pump displacement ratio within the hydraulic transformer and system flow rate controlling of an on/off valve with the duty ratio.
A throttle valve is also used to simulate the load pressure.
"For mathematical modeling, pressure drop across an on/off valve is considered."
"While, a pump and motor can be analyzed with ideal equations."
"Therefore, duty ratio, motor to pump displacement ratio and pressure drop effect the equivalent load pressure and the fluctuation magnitude."
"As a result from a steady state analysis, it has been found that wider equivalent load pressure range can be achieved by increasing the motor to pump displacement ratio."
"In addition, the magnitude of fluctuation is highest at the duty ratio of 0.6."
"For effect of the pressure drop, it reduces the load pressure linearly with the duty ratio."
"Nevertheless, it has been found from the transient analysis that increasing the motor to pump displacement ratio by increasing the motor displacement results in reducing settling time but fluctuation is increased."
"On the other hand, by reducing the pump displacement, the settling time is increased but fluctuation is decreased."
