This article's research has created an analytical hierarchy process on the android operating system by creating a mobile application system to optimize analytical hierarchy process decision making (Analytical Hierarchy Process: AHP).
"This android operating system comprises eight areas for designing mobile apps, which include 1) The optional assignment portion 2) The low threshold part (Threshold Level) 3) The component for picking the first option from the possibilities shown in the first layer."
4) The section for setting the criteria (Criteria) 5) The section for developing the decision hierarchy (Develop Decision Hierarchy) 6) The section Comparison of criteria per pair.
7) Section for estimating the alternative importance of weight (Weight) 8) Section for Sensitivity Analysis.
By employing a sequence analysis approach (AHP) to Increase the effectiveness of decision-making.
It features a distinct working technique that is simple to grasp there are features that may be utilized to determine the value of numerical alternatives as well as to determine the value of numerical alternatives.
Can determine the rationale for the choice this enables decision-makers to organize their thoughts thoroughly and without ambiguity.
Is a method that has been utilized because it aids in the saving of time.
Improve the assessment's accuracy reduced prejudice leads to more credible research.
Because the application system shown here was created for usage on smartphones running the android operating system.
It is available for free download on the “Google Play Store” for those who are interested.
