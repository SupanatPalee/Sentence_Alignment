Graphene materials (GPLs) have attracted a lot of attention.
"Owing to their superior mechanical properties such as Youngâ€™s modulus, high strength, large specific surface area and and good thermal conductivity etc."
The structures considered in this paper are in form functionally graded materials (FGMs) with varying properties over a changing dimension.
The present paper (1) briefly reviews the mechanical properties of graphene and graphene composites; (2) summarizes the characteristics of functionally graded materials (FGM) and fabrication (3) the prediction of effective mechanical properties of composite materials (4) presents a comprehensive review on the mechanical analyses and conclusion respectively.
