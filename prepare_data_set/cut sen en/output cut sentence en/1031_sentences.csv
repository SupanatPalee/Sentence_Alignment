"This research was to compare the study of drying of herbs, Kaffir lime leaves and galangal, between hot air and far-infrared vacuum dryer."
An initial moisture of Kaffir lime leaves and galangal was 170%d.b.
"and 820%d.b., respectively."
The drying would be completed when final moisture was 5%d.b.
The drying by far-infrared vacuum dryer would be conducted by vacuum pressure of 5 kPa and 15 kPa.
"For drying with hot air, the temperatures were controlled at 45˚C and 55˚C."
The result found that the drying by far-infrared vacuum dryer at pressure of 5 kPa and at drying temperature of 55˚C consumed minimal drying time when compared to the drying by hot air.
The effect of pressure and temperature on low-pressure drying and high-temperature drying results in reduced drying time.
"Therefore, the drying rate of vacuum combined far-infrared technique was higher than the rate of hot air drying at atmospheric pressure."
"The optimal condition, considering the drying rate and color quality, for drying of galangal and kaffir lime leaves would be at pressure of 15 kPa by temperature of 55˚C and 45˚C, respectively."
"A volatile matter of galangal and kaffir lime leaves was 0.0928% and 0.7849% by mass, respectively."
