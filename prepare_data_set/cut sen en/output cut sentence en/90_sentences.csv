"Planar parallel manipulator has advantages to carry out high speed and accuracy tasks, but singular configurations can occur within a workspace."
These singular configurations can be eliminated by adding redundant actuation.
"This paper presents an analysis of workspace ratio and Manipulability Index (MI) of a 4-RRR redundant planar parallel manipulator, which is created by introducing a redundant branch with active actuator to a 3-""R"" ̅RR."
"Each branch made up as serial chain connects the moving platform to the fixed base by actuator, two rigid links and 2 passive revolute joints."
A geometry method based on the forward kinematics would be appropriate to determine the workspace.
"Then, 4-""R"" ̅RR workspace is generated by the intersection of all branched."
MI of point in intersection workspace are analyzed.
"Finally, case study, a comparison of workspace ratio and MI of 3-""R"" ̅RR and 4-""R"" ̅RR parallel manipulator shown the 4-""R"" ̅RR redundant structure can improve the MI to 37 times (for 400 mm and 500 mm of lower and upper link length, respectively) when compared with the 3-""R"" ̅""RR"" structure while the workspace ratio reduced to 13.15%."
