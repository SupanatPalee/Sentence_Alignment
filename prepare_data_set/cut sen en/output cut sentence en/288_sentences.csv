This research aims to study the mathematical model of the flat thermosyphon photovoltaic (FTPV).
"In this study created the mathematical model to predict the efficiency of the flat thermosyphon photovoltaic, the experimental of the photovoltaic, and the flat thermosyphon photovoltaic with filling the working fluid of R-11 and R-134a."
"The results showed that the efficiency of the flat thermosyphon photovoltaic from the numerical model were similar with the results measured from the experimental data, with an average error value of 0.44."
"The efficiency data from the FTPV with filling the working fluid of R-134a has higher than the R-11, and the efficiency data from the Photovoltaic (PV) has lowest the efficiency data, with the FTPV of R-134a has the average efficiency better than R-11 of 4.5%"
