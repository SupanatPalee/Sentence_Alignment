The objective of this research is to test the operation of electric motors powered by the battery and solar energy at different slope and load conditions.
"By driving 3-wheel truck up a steep road of 6 and 9 degrees and loading weight of 100 and 200 kg, it was found that a 3-wheel truck with 3 seats was powered by electricity from batteries together with solar power."
By using a DC electric motor with a power of 48 V 750 W and a speed of 2900 rpm.
"and collecting electricity by four 12 V. 45 Ah batteries in series, the 3-wheel truck can be driven at It is powered by 80 W of power, 23 Ah of current, and 3.23 V of high voltage at a 200 kg payload at a 9-degree road slope."
