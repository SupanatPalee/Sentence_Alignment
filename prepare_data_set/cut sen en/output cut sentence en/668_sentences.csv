The average intensity of solar radiation in Thailand is 18.2 MJ/m2 -day.
This amount of energy should be utilized to reduce the energy consumption from the other sources such as the fossil energy.
The main objective of this research is to study the efficiency of a DIY solar water heater.
The solar water heater has two main components: a flat plate collector and a storage tank.
Thermosiphon principle is used for water circulation between the collector and the storage tank.
The collector has 1x1 m2 area and consist of 9 copper tubes with a diameter of 5/8 in.
and a black aluminum plate.
The storage tank has 50 liter volume.
"The thermocouples type K were used to measure the inlet and outlet temperature of water from the collector, and the water in the storage tank."
Pyranometer was used to measure the intensity of solar radiation.
The machine had been tested between 9:00-16:00 for 5 days in April.
The results showed that the mean intensity of solar radiation was about 690 W/m2 and its maximum was 993 W/m2 at 11:45 on the fifth day.
The maximum water temperature in the storage tank was 50 oC at 13:00.
The five days average of the maximum efficiency of each day was 55.8% and the five days average of the all day average efficiency was 24.6%
