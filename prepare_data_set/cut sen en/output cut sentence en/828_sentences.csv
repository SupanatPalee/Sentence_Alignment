"This article presents an overview of waste management behavior and factors affecting waste management behavior of undergraduate students at Thammasat University, Thailand."
Data collection was conducted by using questionnaire survey of 265 samples.
"Statistics used in data analysis were percentage, mean, t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and Least Significant Difference method."
The study revealed that most students had good level of understanding in waste management.
"The respondents engaged in waste sorting, reuse, recycling, rejection of hazardous materials, and repair at moderate level."
"However, waste reduction behavior was practiced at relatively high level."
The hypothesis test showed that there was no significant difference in waste management behavior of male and female except for recycling.
Women recycled wastes at notably larger degree than men.
Social science students engaged in waste reduction at substantially higher degree than science and technology counterparts.
Those in the 5th year or higher practiced waste management at significantly lower degree than students in the other years.
The type of residents had substantial effect on waste management behavior.
Students living at home engaged in more intensive waste management practice than those living on campus and nearby apartments.
"Waste management knowledge had no effect on waste segregation, reduction, and recycle."
This implies that such behaviors may be induced by relatively short-term approach such as providing waste separation facilities.
"However, reuse/repair/rejection were significantly influenced by waste management knowledge so educational campaign should be implemented in order to enhance those types of behavior."
