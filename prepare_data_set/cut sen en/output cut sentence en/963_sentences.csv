The objective of this research is to study the drying kinetics and qualities of dried turmeric.
"Turmeric was dried by combining infrared and vacuum at an absolute pressure of 10 kPa and at temperatures of 40, 50, 60, and 70 째C, respectively."
Turmeric had an initial moisture content of 627.2 %d.b.
and a final moisture content of 11.80 %d.b.
The increase in the drying temperature resulted in a decrease in drying time and specific energy consumption.
"At a drying temperature of 70 째C, the shortest drying time was 180 minutes, and the lowest specific energy consumption was 1.7 MJ/g water evaporated."
"In terms of qualities, increasing the drying temperature resulted in the lightness and redness increasing while the yellowness decreased."
"At a drying temperature of 50 째C, the entire color difference was minimal."
"However, the water activity was within the standard criteria in all experiments."
"Moreover, at a drying temperature of 60 째C, dried turmeric had the highest antioxidant (IC50=0.82 mg/mL) and the highest total phenolic content of 155.83 mg GAE/g."
