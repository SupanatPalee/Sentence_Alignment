This study aimed to compare efficiency of milling direction from an automatic milling machine by using brass as a testing material to test on a mini CNC milling without the use of coolant.
"A series of experiments were done with a 10-millimeter, 4-flute end mill and milling efficiency was measured on surface roughness in two milling directions: tool path compensation left (G41) and tool path compensation right (G42)."
"The experiments was controlled by 3 test factors, each with three levels: spindle speed of 1,200, 1,500 and 1,800 round per minute, feed rate of 80, 100 and 120 millimeters per minute and depth of cut of 3, 4 and 5 millimeters."
"From data collection by using Taguchi method, it was found that a sample milled from the left direction had less surface roughness than a sample milled from the right direction."
"That is, an appropriate brass milling direction for the mini milling CNC without the use of coolant was left-hand milling direction (G41)."
"It was also found that the factor affecting to surface roughness most was depth of cut (77.81 percent), followed by feed rate and spindle speed (14.16 and 8.02 percent respectively)."
