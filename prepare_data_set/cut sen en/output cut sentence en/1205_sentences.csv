"Development of an abandoned mine namely Na Toey located in Amphoe Taimuang,Phangnga, Thailand to be an alternative water supply storage pond for partial domesticand tourism water uses in Phuket province is the main objective of this study."
The MIKEBASIN model was applied as a tool for investigating the suitable storage volume.
"Resultsindicate that before the development, the Na Toey mine could produce water supply atthe maximum rate of 7,500 m3/d without water deficit."
"The pumping rate can, however,be expanded to be 24,000; 48,000; 72,000 and 96,000 m3/d with water shortage allowanceof 3 years in 30 years, if the old mine were excavated to be 0.7, 3.5, 6.1, and 9.3 millionm3 (MCM), respectively."
"In order to mitigate the crisis of 3-years shortage, water deficitmonitoring measures for 2 months early was performed in this study by consideringthe water level and inflow of storage pond in dry season during January to April."
"Thesemeasures lead to project planning for preparing the reserved storage from other sourceswith the maximum annual volume of around 0.5, 0.19, 0.78 and 1.44 MCM, according tothe stage of development, respectively."
