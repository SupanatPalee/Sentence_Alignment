"This study is the development of the garlic peeling machine by circulating air pressure which it is a cylinder with a height of 30 cm, a diameter of 20 cm, the inlet air diameter of 0.5 cm, and the outlet air diameter of 3.8 cm."
"The variables were setup in the experiment within 3 variables: air pressure values, time of experiment, and the amount of garlic."
"The air pressure values were 6, 7, 8, and 9 bar, the experimental time were 10, 20 and 30 seconds/round, and the weight of garlic were 200, 300 and 400 g/round."
"From the results showed that the maximum efficiency of the garlic peeling machine by circulating air pressure was 98.11% at the weight of garlic of 300 g, air pressure of 8 bar, and the experimental time of 30 second."
The maximum peeling capacity was 35.32 kg/hr.
"When, it was compared with other developed machines, this garlic peeling machine was the most effective in peeling the garlic cloves."
It can be used in restaurants where garlic is used in the food ingredient and can be developed by installing air filters to obtain pure air used for garlic peeling to consumption.
