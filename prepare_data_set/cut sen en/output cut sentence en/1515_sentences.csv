"The objective of this article is to show how to derive those conservative laws in fluid mechanics; mass, momentum and energy conservation."
"By the fact that mass in a system is always constant, we could gain the mass conservation equation."
"In the meantime, by the 2nd Newtonâ€™s law, we can deduce the momentum conservation equations."
"Finally, by using the fact, from the 1st law of thermodynamics, that rate of energy changed in a control volume equals to rate of heat combined with rate of work changed in and out of the control volume."
