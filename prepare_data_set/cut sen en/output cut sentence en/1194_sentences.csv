The capacity flexibility for transportation networks is the ability of a transportation networkto accommodate changes in traffic demand while maintaining the efficiency of the transportsystem.
"This research assesses the capacity flexibility of highway network for the Eastern EconomicCorridor area because the EEC project is an engine to drive economic growth, which leads toan increase in the number of activities in this area."
The capacity flexibility of the EEC networkis assessed to determine the ability to handle traffic under demand uncertainty.
Two approachesfor assessing the value of capacity flexibility are measured.
The first approach is based on theconcept of reserve capacity and the second approach allows for variations in the demand patternin addition to changes in demand volume.
The results of the first concept show that there isno reserve capacity.
"Then network was improved based on various scenarios of DOH plans.Once all the projects are completed, the network can handle up to 1.16 times of the currentdemand."
The results of the second concept show that the improved network (period 2022-2036)is more flexible because it can handle more demand patterns.
