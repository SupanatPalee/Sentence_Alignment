This paper presents the study of traffic management in the case of an adjusted layout plan of the Bangkok railway station.
The Bangkok railway station is the main railway station for distributing both passenger and cargo currently.
"Based on the government plan, the Bangkok railway station will be changed to a secondary station which remains the history of Thai railways."
"In this study, there are 3 layout plans, that are applied to simulate traffic situations."
The Travel Demand Modelling (CUBE voyager) has been used to evaluate the efficiency and potential of various traffic management in the case of an adjusted layout plan of the Bangkok railway station.
The results show that 3 scenarios with proposed traffic management and controls based on 3 new layout plans have efficiency and potential difference.
"However, the 2nd scenario based on the 2nd layout plan is the most efficient in terms of traffic management."
The traffic management of the 2nd scenario consists of one-way and two-way traffic modes with 2 traffic lanes all over the road network in the Bangkok railway station.
The Level of Service (LOS) most of the road network in the Bangkok railway station are on A level (Free flow) - B level (Stable flow).
A few of the road network in the Bangkok railway is on C level (Stable flow).
"Based on the analysis of the Level of service (LOS), the movement of vehicles is quite free flow due to a few traffic volumes."
