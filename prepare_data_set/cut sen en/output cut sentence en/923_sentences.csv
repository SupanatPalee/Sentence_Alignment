This research aimed to develop a low-cost synchronous generator experimental test bench (LCSGEB) for power grid synchronization.
"The LCSGEB was designed and built using a synchronous generator which was modified from a 1 phase 220 V 50 Hz 2 kVA brush alternator generator, and using an induction motor as the prime mover, working together with a synchronizing module."
The LCSGEB was obtained by 380 V 50 Hz power grid synchronization testing based on the laboratory.
"The results revealed that, the LCSGEB was ability to synchronize the power grid, supply active and reactive power to grid, and absorb reactive power from grid, as need."
"The LCSGEB could be produced from the local components to reduce cost, which is the advantaged of this research."
