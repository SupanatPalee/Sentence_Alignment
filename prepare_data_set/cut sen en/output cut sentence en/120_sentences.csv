This paper proposes a mathematical model of silicon photovoltaic for photovoltaic system analysis.
The electrical equivalent circuit of solar module is model by MATLAB-Simulink block diagram.
"The Mathematical model is verified by adjusting the parameters of mono-crystalline 30Wp, 100Wp and poly crystalline 150Wp, 280Wp."
The mathematical model was compared against the solar analyzer measurements at different intensity and temperature values in 5 samples.
The results showed that I-V curve and P-V curve of mathematical model was similar to the curve obtained from solar analyzer measurement.
"As for the remaining variables, the maximum current of poly crystalline P.V."
at 280Wp had maximum average error 7.93% at standard deviation 4.88% and Fill Factor (F.F.)
of every P.V.
was between 0.75-0.8 both the solar analyzer measurement and mathematical model
