"The objectives of this research were to study natural dyeing using dyes extracted from fresh and dried leaves of Bouea burmanica Griff, to identify color differences, and to evaluate the color fastness to light, washing, perspiration and abrasion."
"Four types of mordants, namely alum, lime water, iron and fresh eucalyptus leaves were used in the experiments and pre-mordant staining condition was used."
"The results showed that the dyes from fresh and dried leaves were able to dye silk and cotton fibers and obtained different shades according to the type of mordants, including yellow, brown and black."
"In both types of fibers, the dye from the fresh leaves produced a brighter color than the dye from the dried leaves."
Silk fiber was dyed in a brighter hue than cotton fiber.
The usage of iron as a mordant gave the least bright color.
"The dyes from fresh and dried leaves gave a brown hue in both silk and cotton fibers, except when using alum as a mordant the fresh leaves will give a yellow hue."
"In addition, when iron was used as a mordant, it gave a black hue."
It was found that the dye from the fresh leaves gives a darker hue than the dye from the dried leaves.
"Color fastness to light, washing, perspiration and abrasion were all in acceptable levels."
This research shows that the leaves of B. burmanica can be used as a new natural dye and can help to further enhance the development of valuable woven products.
