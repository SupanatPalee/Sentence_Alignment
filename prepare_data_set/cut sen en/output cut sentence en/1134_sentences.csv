This research aims to study and analyze the quantity/characteristics of wastewater from central canteen of Sisaket Rajabhat University (SSKRU); and study the way of solution to treat wastewater from central canteen of Sisaket Rajabhat University.
The method of this research was the study about the quantity/characteristics of wastewater from central canteen by checking wastewater quantity and collecting the samples of wastewater – both before and after passing grease traps – to analyze physical and chemical condition of wastewater while checking the characteristics which related to agricultural activities.
"From the study, the author found 10.9±2.01 cubic meters/day of wastewater (Wednesday showed highest quantity of wastewater: 15.0±3.21 cubic meter/day because this day had most people who had meals at the central canteen each week)."
"After checking wastewater characteristics, wastewater from the central canteen showed Total dissolved solids (TDS), Settleable solid, Suspended solids (SS), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), Fat, oil and grease higher than the standard because the central canteen did not have wastewater treatment system."
There was just only grease traps while there was not any other treatment system.
"In addition, the author found that there were N, P, and K which were much enough for being transformed to be liquid fertilizer."
"Then, this research can present 3 ways of wastewater management: 1) liquid fertilizer transformation; 2) grease trap improvement; and 3) installing the next step of waste water treatment."
The guidelines can be used to develop a wastewater treatment system in a canteen of an organization that has similar wastewater characteristics.
"However, we should study the efficiency of liquid fertilizer transformation, grease trap improvement, and checking the competency of SBR system before actual use to understand methods or quantity to apply in the future."
