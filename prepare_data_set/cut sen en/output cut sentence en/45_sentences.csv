The trend of the age proportion of the Thai population is completely stepping into an aging society.
One of the main problems is that the elderly being left alone spend their lives to do daily activities difficultly due to physical changes.
"For example, falls in the elderly are the most common accidents."
"Therefore the objectives of this research are (1) to develop an alarm and monitoring system for the elderly when the elderly have an accident or injury, and (2) to develop a WiFi network inside residences to bridge data communication between wireless sensing devices and the Raspberry Pi board used as a main controller."
"The wireless sensing devices used to detect abnormal and emergency situations included a fall detector with an accelerometer, a motion detector with a camera and a distance sensor, and an emergency push button."
"When emergency situations were detected according to the pre-defined conditions, i.e., falling or pressing an emergency push button, or no motion within some time intervals, the Raspberry Pi board sent an SMS to a caregiver automatically."
The experimental results showed that the intended objectives were achieved when the alarm and monitoring system was tested in both simulation scenarios and real-world situations.
