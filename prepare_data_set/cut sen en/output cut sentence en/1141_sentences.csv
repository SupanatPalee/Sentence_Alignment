"In this study, the diesel-water emulsion fuels were studied using a rotor-stator type of hydrodynamic cavitation."
The phase stability of emulsion fuel was observed the phase separation time.
"The nanoemulsions have dispersed liquid droplet which the mean droplet size of emulsion fuel was analyzed using the microscope and poly dispersity index (PDI), respectively."
The parameters of the hole diameter (4–6 mm) and the ratio between diameter and hole depth (0.6–1.0) were investigated the mean droplet size of emulsion fuel.
"The fixed parameters were the distance between rotor and stator of 10 mm, the height of rotor of 46 mm, the diameter of rotor of 70 mm."
"The diesel-water emulsion fuel consisted of 80 vol.% diesel, 10 vol.% water, 5 vol.% Span80, 5 vol.% Tween80 (D80W10S5T5), which produced using the rotor-stator type of hydrodynamic cavitation under the condition was                   10.5 L/hr mixture flow rate and 4000 rpm speed of rotor."
The results showed that the maximum stability for emulsifiers of diesel-water blend in the homogenized state were about sixty days.
"The average droplet size and PDI were less than 3 µm, 285 nm and 271 nm respectively, when 4 mm of diameter of rotor, 0.8 and 1.0 of ratio between diameter and hole depth were operated."
"Thus, the nanoemulsion of diesel–water blend can be produced using of rotor-stator type of hydrodynamic cavitation."
The advantages of nanoemulsion were the improvement of combustion efficiency and the reduction of nitrogen oxide in the exhaust gas.
