This article aims to improve the efficiency of the fiberboard transferring process from the warehouse of a case study seaport to the general cargo ship.
"From the transferring process study, it was found the problem of the number of forklifts using for lifting fiberboard in the transferring operation are not enough."
"Consequently, those problem results the averaged berthing time of general cargo ship exceeded the defined standard of the seaport."
"So, the simulation using Arena program was applied with focusing on the study of finding the appropriate number of forklifts."
"It was found that the number of forklifts increased from 6 to be 8 for berth operation area, and it decreased from 5 to be 4 for work on the ship, resulting the averaged berthing time of general cargo ship has decreased from 188.95 hours to 147.04 hours, or it is 22.18 percentage."
