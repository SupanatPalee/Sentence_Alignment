"This research studies the problem of Chonburi province, where is currently the center of the eastern industry."
The construction of road is connected to accommodate the transportation of large trucks.
"The road have been asphaltic concrete surfaces, and usually cracks with resulting in latitude and longitude cracks including the collapse of concrete slabs."
The damage and life period is faster in cause the water to accumulate under the concrete surface.
The researcher would like to study the repair of concrete surface with synthetic fiber with asphalt concrete.
The case study has compared between of reinforced concrete road and reinforced concrete road.
The purpose of this study is a maintenance approach by using synthetic fiber asphalt with asphaltic concrete as traffic surface material and determining the approach of using synthetic fiber with asphalt concrete.
A case study of two roads in district finds the damage of the crack on concrete surface.
"When, the maintenance approach is applied by asphalt concrete in combination with synthetic fiber, which is a comprehensive repair feature with covering the whole panel on joint of concrete slabs."
The results of visual inspection not find the crack on concrete surface and joint concrete slabs after road activation within first year.
"Clearly, the roads are to be at a good level with no crack occurring at the joints of concrete slabs."
"Moreover, the aspect of economic and social can allude to breakeven on investment and safety environment."
"Even thought, the cost of construction of synthetic sheets increased by 16 percent, but it can be reduced maintenance costs by 42 percent within five years."
This exactly could be extended the life period of road.
"Also, the higher quality road results in fuel savings and reduced road accidents."
