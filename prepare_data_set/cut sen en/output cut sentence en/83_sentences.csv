Water loss (WL) in water distribution systems (WDS) is a main problem of waterworks in Thailand.
A WDS can be divided into a trunk main network (TMN) and a water distribution network.
Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) estimates WL in its TMN about 60-120 million m3/year.
"Thus, this research presents a monitoring system using the water balance method for 4 routes of the MWA Prachachuen Branch TMN with fairly complete permanent measured flow data from the Remote Monitoring System."
"Water balance consists of 2 cases: 1) long-term water balance for continuous WL calculation by the data of permanent meters in SCADA systems, and 2) short-term water balance for the case that some flow meters malfunction."
"By closing water flowing through those meters temporarily at night, WL can be computed for a short period of 2-3 hours."
The results show that 1st method can calculate WL if all flow meters work properly.
2nd method can temporarily estimate WL.
And both methods estimate WL with a flow discrepancy of tens digit m3/hr.
"Thus, the system is effective in monitoring leakage on TMN."
