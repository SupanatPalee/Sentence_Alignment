"This research aimed to study the decolorization and degradation of acid yellow 36 in an aqueous solution by comparing three different processes: adsorption on activated alumina prepared from aluminum packaging scrap, oxidation with ozone, and a combination of adsorption and ozone oxidation."
"The effects of pH, initial dye concentration, adsorption time, and ozonation time were investigated."
"The results showed that activated alumina adsorption and ozone oxidation with a single process could remove 98.2% and 97.5% of the dye concentration and reduce the COD by 95% and 65%, respectively, in 50 minutes."
The ozone oxidation process could effectively remove the dye concentration but reduce the COD less than adsorption.
"When using a combination process between adsorption and ozonation in a three-phase system at acidic conditions within 20 min, achieved 98.7% removal of acid dye and a 60% reduction of the COD from 160 mg/L to 64 mg/L."
The kinetics of the acid yellow 36 removal were studied.
It was found that the combined process corresponded to the pseudo-second-order reaction with a higher rate constant than the pseudo-second-order reaction of the single process.
The combined process can be used as an alternative method to effectively reduce the wastewater treatment time.
