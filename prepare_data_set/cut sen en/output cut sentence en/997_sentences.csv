This article proposed a conceptual framework to develop organization management information system by using principles of logistics information flow management.
"The method was divided into seven steps: literature review, data collection, surveys and in-depth interviews, study and analysis of information flow, analysis and design of information systems, development of information systems, manuals preparation and training of information systems, and research conclusion."
"However, this research applied the conceptual framework to develop organization management information system with Faculty of Logistics and Digital Supply Chain, Naresuan University."
The results showed that the conceptual framework consisted of 2 main parts: the central database system to collect information from the service and the information management system to provide services and facilitate the operation of personnel.
"The developed MIS_NU-Logistics system (Prototype) was able to help organizational time management to be more efficient, reducing the operation period from 1-3 days to only half a day."
"Moreover, the system could help organizational resource management to be more efficient, reducing the paper usage by approximately 2,400 sheets per year, or an average of about 2% of total paper usage."
