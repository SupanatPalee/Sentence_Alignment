"The demand and installation capacity for alternative intermittent energy sources such as photovoltaic and wind energy are increasing, but such energy sources require a secondary power source such as a battery to maintain grid reliability and power quality."
This research aimed to develop the prototype and evaluate the performance of an organic electrolyte redox flow battery.
"The redox flow battery prototype in this study was made of aluminum endplates, a brass current collector, a graphite flow field, and a NafionÂ® 117 membrane coated with Vulcan carbon using the ultrasonic spray technique."
"Anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQS) and 1,2-benzoquinone-3,5-disulfonic acid (BQDS) were used as the anode and cathode organic electrolytes, respectively."
The results of comparing the flow rate of the parallel channel at Stage of Charge (SOC) at 100% showed that the flow rate of 300 ml/min had a higher voltage than the flow rates of 400 and 500 ml/min.
"At 2.31V, and a flow rate of 500 ml/min, the maximum current was 231.36 mA."
"Comparing the flow rate of the Serpentinel Channel SOC at 100%, it was found that the flow rate of 500 ml/min had the highest voltage equal to 1.59 V, and the flow rate of 400 ml/min had the highest current of 484.75 mA."
"The Serpentinel Channel test, at a flow rate of 500 ml/min, had the best redox flow battery cell performance."
"Due to its power value, it had the best performance of the redox flow battery cells."
"With an electric power of 19.2 mW and a maximum current of 0.04 amperes, it possessed an electric potential efficiency of 55.81%."
