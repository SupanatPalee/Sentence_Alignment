The purpose of this research was to investigate the factors affecting semi-solid aluminumcasting 7075.
"The welding experiments were carried out under three welding speeds as 450,675 and 1000 rpm, and three welding pressure as 40, 50 and 60 bar, with emphasis effectson macro and microstructure, hardness and tensile strength of welds."
"The results showed thatthe fully deformed zone structure was fine grain at the combination of two metal pieces, whichhad the same direction of grain arrangement because of the influence from the rotation of thelathe."
The strength was increased by the faster welding speed.
The maximum tensile strengthwas 244.6 MPa at a welding speed of 1000 rpm welding pressure of 60 bar.
The efficiency ofreceived strength of the joints was approximately 107.3% comparing with base metal.
