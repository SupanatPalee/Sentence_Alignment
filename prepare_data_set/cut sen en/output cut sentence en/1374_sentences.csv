This paper presents the Hammerstein-spline adaptive filtering based on least mean square algorithm.
"The properties and structure of proposed Hammerstein-spline adaptive filtering is considered with the conventional least mean square algorithm, which can converge to optimum values."
The basic theory of Hammerstein-spline adaptive filtering based on adaptive least mean square algorithm is presented.
Experimental results depict that the proposed Hammerstein-spline adaptive filtering based on adaptive least mean square algorithm can reduce the estimated error rate of proposed Hammerstein-spline adaptive filtering based on adaptive least mean square algorithm.
