This project studies the operation of Delivery Service System by using simulation to help for decision and find the way to increase the efficiency of optimize customer service in freight forwarder company area.
"From the study, by using “work study” principles for collecting the critical data to create simulation which consisted of freight forwarder company plan, the process of working and time."
The study generated three choices for selection.
There were 2 factors using: time and cost.
"Moreover, ProModel program was the main tool for testing the working of three choices."
"The result from the best choice was the combination of the three choices together which increase the efficiency of workers, machines and increased the efficiency of delivery by 24.85%."
by decreasing of 6 workers.
"And also, it could decrease the cost of 6 workers 117,000 baht per month."
