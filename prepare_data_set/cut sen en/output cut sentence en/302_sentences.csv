Basalt quarry dust (BQD) is considered as waste material from basalt milling process.
"Currently, a large amount of BQD is left over and its use is limited."
"This paper aimed to study the properties of BQD mixed with bentonite (BQD-B) for using as liner material, and to determine the effect of different compaction energy and compaction moisture content on its properties for construction as landfill liner."
The BQD used in this study was obtained from a basalt quarry in Ubon Ratchathani province.
"It was found that the addition of 1% of sodium-bentonite to the BQD resulted in the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity of the BQD to the level of 1×10-9 m/s, the required hydraulic conductivity for using as landfill liner material."
"Shear strength of the BQD-B tended to decrease as the compaction moisture content increased, while, the volumetric shrinkage increased as the compaction moisture content increased."
"The optimum compaction condition for the BQD-B can be obtained with the compaction moisture content of 12.0% - 15.5% and the dry unit weight of 18.6 - 20.5 kN/m3, in order to achieve the acceptable quality for using as liner material with safe bearing capacity and minimum shrinkage potential."
