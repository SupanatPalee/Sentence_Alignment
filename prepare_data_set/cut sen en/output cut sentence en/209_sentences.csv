"Due to the intense competition in the Thai infrastructure construction industry, a conventional advantage of construction firms using capital and machinery is outdated."
One thing that the Thai construction firms can do is to better employ human resource management (HRM) and knowledge management (KM) as a tool for increasing the competitive advantage.
This article applies the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to analyze the influence of HRM and KM on organizational performance (OP) in the Thai construction firms.
"The results showed that HRM, KM, and OP are related to each other."
"In fact, HRM had the strongest influence on the performance of firms under study."
"It also had a positive and statistically significant influence on knowledge management, which also affects firms' performances."
