This research was conducted to identify the delay factors in the construction projects of irrigation structure of the Irrigation Building for Regional Irrigation Office 9.
The causes and results of the factors were analyzed to the guideline to control such risks through the questionnaire to survey opinions about factors related to construction management (5M) that causing the delay factors in the construction project of irrigation structure of the Irrigation Building by the experienced civil servants operating their duties for the project under the governance of the Regional Irrigation Office 9th.
"From the study, it was found that the factors contributing to the delays in the construction of irrigation projects, which were conducted by contracting, were competition in terms of contract prices, delays in service areas, workplace infrastructure, errors in reading, and communication error between the controllers and operators."
"On the other hand, the implementation of self-preparedness has presented that the importance of delay factors at the high level are the lack of maintenance equipment, workers, unfavorable climates, natural disasters (such as rain) and unclear construction plan."
"Thus, the research has been suggested the preliminary solution guideline to control such factors and use as the guideline to plan for the construction of irrigation projects that will be occurred in the future such as the competitive price of the contracting price."
"The preliminary solution is to have a measure to register the contractor who will come to the construction in order to screen for the potential contractor, so the contractor can perform actual work."
"And, in the case of unclear drawing construction structure, or have no any details, the preliminary solution is before making any agreement, the contractor should verify the accuracy and completeness of the detailed list form and construction requirements before proceeding to hire for the work, etc."
