"The objective of this research were study factors influencing microstructure and mechanical properties of lap joined using rotary friction welding for aluminum alloy AA6063-T5 by applying the lathe to the welding process between two pieces of aluminum round bar, the diameter of 12 mm, and a length of 85 mm."
"The researcher studied three factors in the experiment defined are the welding speed: 860, 1,400 and 2,000 rpm, The welding time:10, 20 and 30 seconds and the pressure: 10, 20 and 30 bar."
The rotary friction welding process parameters were optimized condition using the Taguchi L9 orthogonal design of experiments.
"As the result, it was found that pressure is the most dominant factor in deciding the ultimate tensile strength of joints."
"Oppositely, the welding speed is the most inconspicuous factor in deciding the joint strength."
"The predicted optimal condition was the welding speed 2,000 rpm, welding time 30 seconds and pressure 30 bar."
"The optimal condition of the experiment gave an ultimate tensile strength of 189.73 MPa, which error from the prediction value of 0.81 percent."
