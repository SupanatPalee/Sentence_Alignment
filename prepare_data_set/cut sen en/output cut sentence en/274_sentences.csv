"Nowadays, the increasing amount of traffic on the road can result in more repeating loading and is a cause of the pavement distresses."
The surface distresses caused by the repeated load produce permanent deformation of surface pavements.
The test for engineering property on asphalt concrete for finding the permanent deformation can be processed by doing the dynamic creep test in the repeating loading manner.
The present study then compared the permanent deformation and the accumulating strain of asphalt concrete mixed with the AC 60-70 binder and polymer modified asphalt binder with limestone which consisted of two types namely Upper Limit gradation and Lower Limit gradation by testing the asphalt concrete at the temperature 40ºC.
The results showed that the resistance of the permanent deformation of asphalt concrete was depended on the type of asphalt binder and the gradation of aggregate.
"Then, the asphalt binder mixed with the polymer modified asphalt binder had higher permanent deformation resistance than asphalt concrete mixed with the AC 60-70 binder."
"Finally, the specimen with Upper Limit gradation had higher permanent deformation resistance than Lower Limit gradation."
