"This is one of the most important problems that will affect road traffic, causing traffic congestion."
The main approach is to increase promote the usage of the mass transit system.
"However, reducing traffic congestion on major roadway coordinate is also very important as well."
Improving the intersection operation to accommodate increased usage and increasing the coordination system of the system is an accepted solution.
"In this research work, a traffic signal coordination study is conducted to improve a traffic flow condition and to reduce the number of stops on the main roadway."
A case study of The Royal Initiate Project Road of His Majesty King Rama IX (Pra Ratchadumri Road) between Pra Ratchadumri Road – Phet Uthai Road – Si Rat Expressway Intersection and Piyavate Hospital Intersection.
Synchro – a traffic signal coordination simulation software is used to experiment and test for this technique.
A result of this study shows that applying the traffic signal coordination technique does help improve traffic flow conditions and reduce vehicle stops on this main corridor.
