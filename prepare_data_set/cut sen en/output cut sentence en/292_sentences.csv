"Nowadays, many hospitals usually face the treatment scheduling problem due to increasing the number of patients, resource limitations, and multiple procedures in the system."
"Also, the cleft lip and cleft palate patient treatment in Thailand is facing with scheduling problem, owing to the complicated treatment and long treatment procedure."
"According to this situation in Thai hospitals, this paper aims to propose a mixed integer linear programming model for cleft lip and cleft palate treatment scheduling problem, in which the patients are assigned to be treated at an appropriate time under the limitations of the procedure and the hospital."
"Firstly, the proposed mathematical model was compared with the previous model, in which the results found that the proposed model can be superior to the previous model in both solution time and the number of variables."
"Then, the proposed mathematical model was developed based on several conditions such as capacity limitations, age limitations, multiple hospitals, the doctor conditions, and multiple treatment periods."
"Moreover, the developed mathematical model determined three objective functions that compose of the shortest path between the patient’s residence and the hospital, the highest preference score of patients to hospitals, and the minimization of the makespan."
Three objective functions were formulated as the single objective function using the normalization and weight-sum method.
The developed model was verified and validated by a small size generated data using the exact solver ​​from Lingo 14.0.
"Finally, the developed model was applied to the small size real world case."
The result found that the proposed mathematical model can schedule the treatment plan appropriately under the collected conditions and procedures with a short time.
This paper will be of great significance in helping doctors or staff consider the cleft lip and cleft palate patient treatment scheduling in Thai hospitals as well.
