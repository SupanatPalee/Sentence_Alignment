This paper presents the performance improvement of harmonic detection using the Synchronous Detection with Fourier analysis (SDF) method to calculate the reference current of a shunt active power filter (SAPF) for single-phase power systems.
The Positive Sequence Voltage Detector (PSVD) is applied to the SDF method to improve the accuracy of the reference current calculation in the case of a distorted voltage source.
Where the objective is to enhance the effectiveness of harmonic elimination for single-phase power systems.
"For the harmonic detection testing, the hardware-in-the-loop simulation technique of the Simulink/MATLAB program and the TMS320C2000TM Experimenter Kit DSP board are used to simulate the harmonic elimination system."
The simulation is divided into two cases of voltage sources: a pure sinusoidal waveform and a distorted waveform caused by harmonics.
The simulation results show that harmonic detection using SDF in cooperation with the PSVD method (SDF+PSVD) can reduce the percentage of the total harmonic distortion (%THD) value of the source current to 3.07% for the case of a pure sinusoidal voltage waveform and to 2.00% for the case of a distorted voltage waveform.
These %THD values are lower when compared with the SDF method and synchronous detection (SD).
"From the result, it confirms that the SDF cooperated with the PSVD method can provide better performance for harmonic detection."
"Therefore, the shunt active power filter can effectively eliminate current harmonics in the single-phase power system."
"Moreover, %THD of the source current after compensation is also satisfied under the IEEE std."
