This research was to study the wear and mechanical properties of A356-SiC composite material.
"The study applied the 12.5-Î¼m SiC particles and increased the quantity of SiC reinforcement by 5, 10, 15 and 20 % of the weight."
"In the stir casting process, the stainless-steel blades were set at 300 revolutions per minute."
"With the increase of SiC reinforcement quantity by 5, 10 and 15 % of the weight, silicon carbide enhanced the hardness property of the composite material."
"However, the increase of SiC reinforcement quantity by 20 % of the weight caused the small cracks on the matrix phase."
"The hardness of the composite material was 79.89, 85.27, 89.63 and 73.27 HB, respectively."
"Upon the impact test, the increased SiC reinforcement resulted in the decreased impact energy at 4, 2.66, 2.66 and 2 joules, respectively."
"In the wear test at the room temperature and relative humidity of 40-60% in the laboratory, the 5 N load and a 1,000-meter sliding distance were applied."
It was found that the wear rate of the composite material decreased in proportion to the increased SiC reinforcement.
