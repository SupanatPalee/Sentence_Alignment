This research aims to study the effect of fineness and percentage of limestone powder for cement replacement on the development of compressive strength in the first state of the concrete.
Mortars cast at water to binder ratio (w/b 0.45) and at binder to sand ratio 1:2.75 were tested in this research.
The cement was replaced with the limestone powders whose fineness were 5 microns and 8 microns in the proportion of 5% and 10%.
Casting of the mortar samples to perform compressive strength testing was conformed to the standard test of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 168.
The test result revealed that the fineness and the percentage of cement replacement affected the development of compressive strength of mortars.
"The result found that M95LP5-10 showed its highest compressive strength, 46 MPa, 59 MPa and 65 MPa at 3 days, 7 days and 28 days, respectively."
