"Phitsanulok Province always faces the problem of floods almost every year; therefore, planning and management for flooding are needed."
"In addition, the process of helping flood victims is still slow because of the difficulty in accessing the flooding areas and lack of flood risk area assessment."
"The purpose of this study were to investigate the management process and preparation of helping flood victims of related sectors in Phitsanulok Province, and develop a simulation model for flood risk area prediction in Phitsanulok Province by using the Geographic Information System (GIS)."
"Based on the prediction model, six levels of water when flooding were divided: 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m, 2.5 m, and 3.0 m. Knowing the flood risk areas through levels of water could be useful for warning of floods in terms of the distance and time for the rescuers to reach the areas."
The results of the assessment of related sectors to have access to the flood risk areas showed that their service areas did cover all risk areas in Phitsanulok Province.
"Thus, it was suggested that six flood relief operation centers should be established to help flood victims efficiently in Bangkrathum District, Bangrakam District, and Phromphiram District."
"In addition, the prediction model will help to improve the planning process to help flood victims efficiently."
