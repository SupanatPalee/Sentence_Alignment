The aim of this work is to develop a lotus leaves forming machine and study the suitable forming conditions.
"The machine has three important components including 1) the hydraulic control, 2) the mold set, and 3) a temperature-controlled heating."
"This machine is used to form containers at different temperatures, pressure levels, forming times and the number of layers of lotus leaves."
The results show that the optimal condition of experimental design in the compression molding of a lotus leaf temperature is 150 degree Celsius at a pressure of 300 pound per square inch.
Four layers of lotus leaves with 5 minutes compression are used.
"Then, the mechanical and physical properties of the products were studied in order to determine the best condition for production process."
"For the tensile testing, the tensile stress of container is 5.07 MPa with 1.11 percentage of elongation at break."
The result of the thermal testing shows that containers are deformed after 1 minute.
"In addition, the percentage of absorption is 69.29."
