"In Group C, there were 153 items with a value of 788,593 baht or 5.00 percent."
"Group A inventory had a variability coefficient (VC) of less than 0.25, in which all items were suitable for an EOQ model."
"It was found that the number of economical orders for Group A inventory ranged from 5-11 times a year, and there was a reorder point (ROP) when the inventory was reduced to 3-18 units in the warehouse."
"A comparison of the current model with the EOQ model showed that the EOQ model could reduce the cost of ordering by 197,386 baht or 58.03 percent, and the cost of storage by 5,213 baht or 3.39 percent."
