Cracks of taxiways and aprons causes subsiding due to water ingress into pavement.
This affects the usability of the airport.
There is a time limitation for repairing as it should be enabled as soon as possible.
"The objective of this research is to compare the efficiency of concrete repairing by Stitching Dogs by using 3 materials: Steel sheet 1 inch, thickness 3 millimeters, steel round bar diameter 6 millimeters and carbon fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strip by welding using epoxy."
It was also compared with repair by epoxy only and with the original concrete that has not been repaired.
"The repair efficiency was determined by the flexural strength, water permeability and abrasion resistance."
"The test results showed that Stitching Dogs with Steel sheet 1 inch, thickness 3 millimeters will be the most effective, steel round bar diameter 6 millimeters and carbon fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) respectively."
The correlation between the abrasion resistance and the flexural strength was attained as the higher flexural strength was the higher abrasion resistance.
"However, it was not affecting the permeability because the size of the wound repairer was more affected on the permeability."
