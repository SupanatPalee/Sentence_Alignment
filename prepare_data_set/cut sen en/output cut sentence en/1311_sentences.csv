"Nowadays, the demand of electrical machines is increasing rapidly."
Relay and switch are the important parts of electronic equipment.
Improving the production capacity of electronic components is necessary to accommodate the fast-growing demand of relay and switch and to meet the needs of customers.
The objectives of this study were to improve the production capacity of the electronic components of the relay and switch.
Fish bone diagram was used to find the influencing factors of the production capacity.
We found that the using speed of machine below the machine capacity is the main factor of the problem.
"After improved the production capacity by increasing the speed of machine, the production capacity of the part of relay and switch increases up to 66.67 percent and the number of working days to be completed within a period reduces to 40.00 percent."
