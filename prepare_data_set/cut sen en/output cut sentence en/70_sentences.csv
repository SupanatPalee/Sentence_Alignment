This paper presents a simulation program that utilizes the MATLAB GUI interface to calculate part values and display frequency responses for wireless communication systems filters.
"The simulation supports computational theory with three circuit models: T-model, Pi-model, and K-inverter."
"Users have the flexibility to choose their desired filter response type, schematic, filter type, passband ripple configuration, and response order."
The simulation's complex equations enable accurate element value calculation and circuit design.
"Additionally, users can compare frequency response graphs to facilitate on-demand analysis and design."
"The simulation results are in agreement with filter theory, making it an effective tool for teaching and learning the fundamentals of frequency response in wireless communication."
"Furthermore, the filter element values derived from the simulation can be employed in advanced circuit design."
