This research proposes an application of the NI myRIO device for the detection of knitted fabrics.
"In the textile industry, the fabric inspection is an important process in controlling the quality of the fabric."
"The NI myRIO microcontroller in conjunction with the LabVIEW program and the Web Camera is installed on an inspection machine, designed as a prototype."
"The machine rolls up knitted fabrics and then the fabrics moves through a detection area, in which the camera is connected to the NI myRIO device."
"Next, an image captured after a deflect exists is sent to be processed and analyzed by the NI myRIO device."
An area pixel is computed based on HSL system and interpreted for defect selection.
This procedure is performed on Region of interest (ROI) to verify the defect.
"Three defects, examined in this research, consist of drop stitches, threads, and tongues."
"These are distorted from the testing and adjustment of the space through the image HSL system, it was found that the defects of 3 knitted fabrics can be accurately checked."
The proposed method can be available to the textile industry.
