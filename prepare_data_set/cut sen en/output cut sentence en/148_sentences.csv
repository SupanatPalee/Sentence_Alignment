This paper presents a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of single-phase grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system using non-iterative method.
The proposed method considers the change in PV voltage.
The reference maximum power of PV panel was calculated by the open-circuit voltage (Voc).
"Therefore, the power response using the proposed method is faster than that from the iterative MPPT methods."
The effectiveness of the proposed non-iterative method was confirmed by computer simulation and hardware in the loop simulation using a TMS320F28335 microcontroller board with MATLAB/Simulink.
The results show that the proposed MPPT method can reach the maximum power point in a shorter time compared with the traditional iterative methods.
