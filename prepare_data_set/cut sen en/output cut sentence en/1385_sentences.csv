This paper presents the design and implementation of a small seed sowing robot prototype using the Arduino development board.
"According to the autonomous movement, this robot will follow the path for each crop."
The robot will dig and sow for 3-4 seeds per hole at the same time.
The distance between the holes is of 20-25 centimeters that the robot will sow the seeds along the specified path.
"In the experiment, the tests are performed using the corn seeds for example."
Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Module is applied for detection.
The controlled system consists of manual and automatic system.
The practical results obtain from autonomous mode at 20 meters.
It was found that the robot spends an average of 2.08 minutes for 20 meters with average error at 9.7 centimeters that is equal to the percentage of average error of 4.85 %.
