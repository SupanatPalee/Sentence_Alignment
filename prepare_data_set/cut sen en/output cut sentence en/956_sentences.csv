"This research aims to: 1) study the formation of colors, lightness, and color values of product textures after being fired with different oxides; 2) examine the marble patterns of pottery with different clay texture layer arrangements and 3) investigate the marble pattern of pottery products molded by a wheel throwing using different molding periods."
"The research was conducted using a purposive sampling of stoneware clay mixtures with oxides including chromic oxide, cobalt oxide, and ferric oxide at 3% concentration by weight."
"The clay was arranged in layers and in coils, and the molding time was set by a wheel throwing in every step for two-time intervals of 5 and 10 minutes."
They were fired at 1230 degrees Celsius in oxidation.
The results showed that both layer- and coil-clay arrangements produced similar marble patterns.
The appropriate molding time with a wheel throwing was 10 minutes.
"The suitable formulas were 3, 4, 7, and 8, with arrangements in 4 and 6 layers of alternate colored clay."
