The objective of this study is to apply line balancing and ECRS techniques to analyses and provide improved methods in order to reduce the roasted peanuts packing process waste time.
"From the study result, the highest packing process waste time is the time for peanuts filling operation."
The major root cause came from a lack of working standards.
"Therefore, after the adoption of line balancing and ECRS techniques such as rearrange, combine, eliminate, and simplify, waste time roasted peanuts packing process was reduced 5.15 sec from 20.75 to 15.60 sec that was 25% reduction from the original time."
"Moreover, Total capacity of packing process was increased 43 unit/hour and manpower was reduced 1 person"
