The seed and peel of Langsat (Lansium domesticum Corr.)
were extracted with methanol ethanol and water as solvent and tested for their biological activities.
"The extracts were tested for their properties included antioxidant activity (DPPH assay, ABTS assay and FRAP assay), antiglycation activity, tyrosinase inhibitor, antibacterial activity, total phenolic contents and HPLC determination of phenolic compounds."
"The results revealed that methanol peel extract was the most effective extract which showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (48.80±0.09 mg TE/ g DW), tyrosinase inhibitor (181.05±11.09 mg KAE/g DW) and total phenolic contents (27.62±1.37 mg GAE/ g DW)."
"While the peel water extract showed the highest ABTS radical scavenging activity (128.30±1.41 mg TE/ g DW), ferric reducing antioxidant power (0.88±0.07 mg TE/ g DW ) and antiglycation activity (24.26±5.89 % AGE inhibition)."
"In addition, the seed methanol extract revealed the highest antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus sp."
The determination of phenolic compounds by HPLC found only protocatechuic acid in both seed and peel extracts.
"This study indicated that the peel extracts of Langsat was suitable for cosmeceutical product, pharmaceutical products and dietary supplements development with natural ingredient."
