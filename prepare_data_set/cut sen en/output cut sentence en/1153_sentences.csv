The objective of the research aims to study carbon dioxide removal from biogas with water absorbance in water scrubber.
"In this experiment, the mixture between carbon dioxide gas and air was supplied to swirl type microbubble generator and generated microbubble gas then floated to the water column to absorb carbon dioxide gas in water."
"The experiment conditions consisted of carbon dioxide concentration at 30%, 40% and 50%, the flow rate of mixture gas at 0.1 litre/minute."
"The flow rate of water supplied to the generator was varied at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 litre/minute."
The results show that the increasing of water flow rate will increase the swirl velocity in the generator and increase the shear force on gas flow for reducing the size of gas bubble.
The average diameter of generated bubble are in range of 50.44-116.04 µm.
The carbon dioxide removal performance can reach to 92.46%.
While the water flow rate has small effect on carbon dioxide removal.
