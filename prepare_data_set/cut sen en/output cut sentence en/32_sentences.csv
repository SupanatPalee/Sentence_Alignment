The objectives of this research are gaining knowledge and improving the layout of the product in Srithai Superware Korat exhibition warehouse.
The current improper layout of the product in this warehouse leads to the problem of not achieving 100% on time delivery.
This research will use both the ABC Classification system and the line programming module to rearrange the product priority and products that move frequently should be considered to be placed nearest to the door.
The expected result for this implementation of this exhibition product layout is a decreasing distance of picking products in the warehouse for each order every month.
"The result of this research is firstly, the distance of picking the product in the warehouse decreased by 22.54%."
"Secondly, the electricity bill for the forklift decreased by 22.54%."
"Lastly, the total cost of the picking product process decreased by 2.22% per month."
