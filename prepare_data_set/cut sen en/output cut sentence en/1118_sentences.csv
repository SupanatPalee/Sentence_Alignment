"This research presents a development of environmental-friendly plastic (EFP) composite material between synthetic materials mixed with natural materials, consisting of liquid polyester resin, aluminum powder, talcum powder and clay brick powder for use as a material create thermoforming process vacuum forming mold."
The operating by mixed EFP composite material test specimen 32 pieces.
Specify the weight of each ingredient equal to 20 grams and take the specimen check for hardness according to ASTM D2240(1990) Shor-D hardness level.
"Test results from the research found that mixed materials, EFP is Â 10 grams of liquid polyester resin, 2 grams of aluminum powder, 4 grams of talcum powder, 4 grams of brick and a setting time 6 hours powder with the best hardness of 84.6 Shor-D."
Suitable for creating vacuum molds to increase the choice of materials in the production Industry sector.
