"This paper presents the comparative studies of six robust state estimation methods, i.e., least absolute value method, quadratic-constant method, quadratic-linear method, square root method, Schweppe-Huber generalized M method, and maximum exponential square method for power system state estimations."
The IEEE 14-bus and 57-bus systems are used to test the performances of the robust estimation methods.
"The measurement datasets consist of voltage magnitude, power flow, and power injection."
"In addition, the influence of the constant parameters of objective functions of some robust state estimations is studied."
"Comparison results in terms of solution convergence, computation time, and estimation accuracy are presented."
