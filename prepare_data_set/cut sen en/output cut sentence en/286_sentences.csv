Aniline is an aromatic amine widely contaminated in environment.
"This study aimed to investigate influence of aniline concentrations on aniline removal, aniline biodegradation kinetics, and intermediate product monitoring."
"Pseudomonas fluorescens strain MC46 (MC46), which is a choloaniline-degrading bacterium, was chosen."
The result showed that MC46 (108 CFU/mL) could remove aniline (1-100 mg/L) for approximately 17-43%.
The experiments with low initial aniline concentrations (1-10 mg/L) well performed while MC46 cell numbers and aniline removal efficiencies were obviously lower during the experiments with high initial aniline concentrations (30-100 mg/L).
"Inhibitory aniline removal kinetic analysis followed Andrews model with maximum specific aniline removal rate (qmax) of 1.68x10-4 mg/L/CFU/L-d, half-saturation coefficient (Ks) of 9.7 mg/L, and Inhibition constant (Ki) 13.9 mg/L."
"From the intermediate product monitoring, catechol occurred during the experiment but MC46 could degrade catechol as well."
The result from this study indicated possibility of MC46 for aniline and intermediate product removal practice in the future.
