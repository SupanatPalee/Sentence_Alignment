A method was developed web application of price assessment of a smartphones pawned by using Deep learning.
"In the experiments, three datasets collected by smartphones for a total of 4,026 subjects are used for eveluations."
"It is proposed the forecasting with the image processing, the TensorFlow library, the Deep learning library, and the CNN algorithm techniques."
"The experiments show that the prototype model for price assessment of a smartphones pawned achieves an accuracy values of the front and back view images of smartphones status at 74.50% and at 82.90%, respectively."
"A prototype model was developed web application that is designed to work on all devices by using software tools such as subline text, PHP, and JavaScript."
