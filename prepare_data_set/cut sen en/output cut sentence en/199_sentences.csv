"This research investigated the operational procedures of a waste recycling collection warehouse business                        by studying current working conditions, starting from the process of receiving an offer from customers through to the process of going out to receive waste from customers."
"It was found that among the work procedures of staff who went out to buy waste from customers, many operations were complicated and redundant and also on the side of              the accounting staff, whether in recording data, calculations, or summarizing various types of waste."
"This research is              the development of an application to support recycled waste collection warehouses to optimize their work processes by applying ECRS principles to improve operational efficiency, starting with the use of industrial engineering techniques, consisting of the study of operational procedures, flow charts, operational process charts, cause-and-effect diagrams, 5W 1H analysis, and applying ECRS principles to find ways to improve performance, then designing and creating applications.The researcher designed an application with the AppSheet program to link the database with Spread Sheet, an online database storage system."
"The system can record purchases and calculate transactions, create receipts, and send notifications via Line and E-mail programs to relevant parties within the organization."
"The results of the application development, compared with conventional operating procedures, showed that the work process of the conventional waste purchasing staff employed 7 steps that were reduced to 4 steps, decreasing work time 9.12 minute, accounting for a 43.32 percent decrease."
"Previously, the work process of accounting staff had 8 operational procedures which were reduced to 6, and the time taken was reduced 13.69 minute, a 57.09 percent reduction."
The sample’s overall satisfaction with the application was at a high level with a mean of 4.19 and a standard deviation of 0.46
