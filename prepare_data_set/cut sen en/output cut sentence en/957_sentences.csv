"The objectives of this research were to determine the optimum microemulsion ratio by mixing B7 diesel fuel, biofuel, and surfactants and examine the properties of mixed fuel obtained from a Microemulsion process compared with B7 diesel and biofuel produced from sugar cane bagasse, of which the quality was improved by the Microemulsion process containing surfactant of 5% v/v – 20% v/v and B7 diesel fuel of 50% v/v – 90%."
"This research also studied the properties of mixed fuel, namely chemical composition, heating value, density value, kinematic viscosity, and flash point."
"The results of the experiment showed that there were 2 appropriate  proportions in mixing B7 diesel, biofuel and surfactants."
"The first proportion consisted of B7 diesel 55%v/v: Biofuel 25%v/v: Surfactant 20%v/v, and the second proportion consisted of B7 diesel 50%v/v: Biofuel 30%v/v: Surfactant 20%v/v."
"According to the study of mixed fuel properties including heating value, density value, kinematic viscosity, and flash point, it was found that the viscosity of the two proportions was lower than that of biofuel, and the heating value was higher than that of biofuel, because both proportions contained B7 diesel which led these two proportions to have higher heating value and lower viscosity than biofuel."
"When comparing the two proportions of mixed fuel with B7 diesel, it was found to have higher viscosity than B7 diesel in both proportions as they contained highly viscous biofuel, but the heating value, density, and flash point of these two proportions were similar to B7 diesel."
