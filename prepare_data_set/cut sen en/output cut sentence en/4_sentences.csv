"This research aimed to develop a 200-liter iron kiln to produce biochar and wood vinegar from pineapple leaves provided from Khao Khan Song sub-district, Sriracha district, Chon Buri province."
The preliminary experiments were conducted in the laboratory scale to determine the optimum operating temperature and time for biochar production.
"The experimental results showed that the highest solid yield was 33.02 wt.%, obtained at 400 Â°C and for 1 h, with the highest heating value as 23.25 MJ/kg."
"The 200-liter iron kiln was then developed consisting of 3 parts: biochar production kiln, condensation apparatus for storing wood vinegar and combustion kiln for heat production."
It was found that the developed 200-liter iron kiln could produce biochar and wood vinegar from pineapple leaves.
The 20 kg of pineapple leaves can produce approximately 2 kg of biochar and 10 kg of wood vinegar.
The analysis of biochar revealed that biochar had 70.49 wt.% of Carbon content with the highest heating value of 25.97 MJ/kg.
"The generated wood vinegar is mainly composed of Phenols and Phenol derivatives, including Guaiacol which has antifungal and antibacterial properties."
The wood vinegar could be used in agricultural areas to eliminate root rot disease and plant fungi.
It could also be sprayed in order to inhibit germs growth and some pests as well.
"The analysis of costs, the possibility of product creation and implementation presented that the number of payback operations was 16 and resulted in a wide variety of value-added products."
