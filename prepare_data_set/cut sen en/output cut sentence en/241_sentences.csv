This study aimed to investigate the cooling efficiency and coefficient of performance of a vortex tube with change in the arc distance of a vortex tube cone valve.
"A study was performed using the arc distance of vortex tube cone valves at sizes of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mm."
"The pressure was adjusted at the inlet vortex of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 Bar."
"The experiment used uncontrolled temperature air, air at an ambient temperature of about 33 °C."
"From the experiment, results showed that an increase in the arc distance on a vortex tube cone valve affects the outlet temperature on both sides."
"The increased pressure led to a drop in temperature at the cold exit, which was in proportion to the increase in the cooling efficiency and coefficient of performance."
"At 3 mm, it was the best cooling efficiency and coefficient of performance."
The maximum cooling efficiency was 25.2 % and the maximum coefficient of performance was 0.11.
At the inlet pressure was 2.5 Bar and the flow rate was 3.5 m3/h.
"The air outlet has a minimum cold air temperature of 8.9 °C, a drop of 23.4 °C, and a high temperature of 60.3 °C, an increase of 24.4 °C at an inlet pressure of 4 Bar."
Inlet air flow rate 6.5 m3/h
