This research was design and invention of cleaning machine for children plastic ball to mitigate the issue of slowly cleaning the balls from labors.
The principle of this cleaning machine was conveying the ball by screw conveyer that has the screw blade as plastic brush.
"While the screw conveyer rotates, the screw plastic blush can convey and simultaneously brush the balls."
The screw conveyer was dipped into ethanol and sloped with vertical of 45 degree.
The screw pitch was 0.10 m that is enough for conveying the balls with diameter of 0.075 m. The blade angle was 30 degree.
The screw conveyer comprised of 5 screw blades and 3 screw blades were dipped into ethanol.
The power source for screw conveyer was designed to use 1 hp motor.
"Moreover, the rotational speed can be adjusted by inverter in the range of 70 to 120 rpm."
The results show that the efficiency of children ball cleaning machine were around 95%.
"The cleaning rate of this machine was 181 balls per minutes (10,860 balls per hour) at the rotational speed of 90 rpm."
This rate was higher than the labor rates for 4 times.
It can also reduce the number of labors to be 1 person to control machine.
