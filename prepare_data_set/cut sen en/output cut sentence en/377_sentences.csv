This research aimed to design welding tables with Ergonomics principles using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques.
"Due to the traditional welding table, it causes fatigue."
And using the Pugh matrix to select materials and parts of the welding tables.
"The results of the analysis of the top three highest average importance (IMP) are optimum height, Fire protection, and weld handle provided."
"When designing and prototyping to simulate standing posture, it was found that the user group's satisfaction increased from 3.04 to 4.52, or increased to 22.7 percent."
