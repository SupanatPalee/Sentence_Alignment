This research study on the effect of the phase change material (PCM) in beverage cooler to reduce its energy consumption.
This study has focused on the effect of its application with evaporator by submerging the cooling pipe in PCM.
The PCM mixing include polyethylene glycol 30% and water 70%.
"The experimental results indicate that by using beverage cooler with the PCM, power consumption is reduced by 19.36% compared to the beverage cooler without the PCM."
The payback period of the modified one was around 7.50 years at the PCM cost of around 100 Baht.
Economic analyses show that using of PCM in beverage cooler is clearly a cost effective method that saves energy and reduces harmful emissions.
