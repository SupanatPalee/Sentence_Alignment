The maintenance plan of the fire pump system is particularly important for firefighting in petrochemical jetty and terminal.
"The existing maintenance plan still lacked detection of abnormalities, therefore, resulting in many failures of the fire pumps during practicing the emergency plans."
"When measuring the availability of fire pumps, the value was only 65.4%."
"This research, therefore, aimed to improve the maintenance plan by adding methods for detecting abnormalities of the fire pump system."
"The components of the fire pump system in this research consisted of electric motors, diesel engines, and fire pumps."
"In conducting the research, started from 1) analyzing the failures of the components of the fire pump system, 2) arranging the sequence of failures that cause these failures, 3) finding the methods to detect the abnormalities that cause each failure."
"These methods would be defined in the revised maintenance plan, 4) doing according to the maintenance plan."
"The results of the initial phase showed that 9 abnormalities were detected in advance, then the abnormalities were remedied immediately."
"After that, detecting the abnormalities and maintaining according to the revised maintenance plan was performed continuously."
"When monitoring results for one year, there was no further failure."
