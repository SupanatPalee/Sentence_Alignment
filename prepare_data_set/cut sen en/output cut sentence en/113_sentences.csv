This research can help improve the quality of life for the visually impaired people based on the voice speaking in Thai and English.
"It improves on the algorithm, which reduces the delay on audio processing, making it more real-time."
The accuracy of measured distance associated with angles in front of ultrasonic sensor was tested.
"For safety of a glasses wearer, it examined the amount of Ultrasonic wave reflection on five different materials: sponges, glass, wood, metal, and plastic water bottle."
Test results consisted of two parts.
First part was for those five materials.
"Only sponges absorbed the ultrasonic wave, while other materials reflected it back."
Reflecting results of precise distance from waves of each materials were diagnosed in order to improve on mechanisms to position equipment and system design to ensure safety for blindness.
Second part was satisfaction questionnaires to be assessed by the normal vision people and the visually impaired.
"The questionnaires were designed on six aspects: safety, hardware design, measured distance accuracy, faster warning sound, the cost, and the convenience and versatility of wearing glasses."
The assessment of all aspects yield good results.
