"The objectives of this paper aim 1) to study the effects of Feldspar glazing on glaze color and brightness, 2) to study the physical qualifications of Feldspar glazing with Tin Oxide, Zinc Oxide, and Barium Carbonate as additives."
"The sampling plan is used in the experiment by sampling diagram from Triaxial diagram which the suitable number of experiments is 10 mixtures and each mixture includes 1%, 3%, and 5% of Copper Oxide."
"The characteristic of physical qualifications has been studied after burning at 1,230 Degrees Celsius under an oxidation atmosphere."
The results of this research showed that (1) The color from Feldspar glaze consists of two-color tones which are turquoise and green tones.
"Turquoise colors shown in mixture 1-3 that has 1% of Copper Oxide, while green colors shown in mixture 1-3 that has 3-5% of Copper Oxide, and mixture 4-10 that has 1-5% of Copper Oxide."
"(2) The color glazing from Feldspar according to the color chart is at a* shade which has the average at -9.65 to -11.10, at b* shade which has the average at +12.77 to +16.64, and at L* shade which has the average at +50.80 to +24.30."
(3) The physical qualifications from Feldspar glaze showed complete and glossy characteristic in every mixture.
"(4) The developed Feldspar glaze consists of constituents such as 45% of Potash Feldspar, 10% of Dolomite, 13% of Calcium Carbonate, 7% of Kaolin, 25% of Quartz, 2-8% of Tin Oxide, 1-7% of Zinc Oxide, 1-7% of Barium Carbonate, and 1-5% of Copper Oxide can be used in Feldspar glaze that contains Tin Oxide, Zinc Oxide, and Barium Carbonate as the additives."
