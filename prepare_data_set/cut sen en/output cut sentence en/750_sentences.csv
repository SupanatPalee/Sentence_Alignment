This research was to propose guidelines for adoptatipon international standard energy management systems (ISO 50001: 2018) for effectiveness and sustainability.
"Researches, Energy Management Standards, and relevant energy management guidedance were studied and reviewed."
Together with information and data colection of the 18 best practice energy management systems industries according to the PDCA was surveyed.
The results of study presented the ideas for analyzing energy management systems as sub-processes in the management process frame works and the analysis of key process input variables (KPIVs) of each process influencing on the deviations of the quality level and sustainability of energy management systems.
The application guidelines for the sustainable energy management systems are the key process guidelines to control the input variables of the energy management system in order to reduce the risk or deviation that will affect the result of each process which is the crucial part of sustainable energy management systems.
"The purpose of this study aims to determine the influence of machining parameters which were consisted of three parameters; feed per tooth, cutting speed and depth of cut on surface roughness in CNC face milling process of ADC 12 aluminum alloy."
The settings of machining parameters were conducted through 3 levels full-factorial design with 2 replicates.
"In addition, CNC machining center and carbide insert were fitted together with milling cutter which 63 millimeters of diameter, under wet cutting condition."
The surface roughness of end-milled face was measured by the surface roughness tester.
"It was found that the most influence main factor was feed per tooth, followed by cutting speed."
"It was also found that interaction between cutting speed and feed per tooth, cutting speed and depth of cut as well as feed per tooth and depth of cut also impact the surface roughness."
"In contrast, Depth of cut was not affected on surface roughness at significant level of 0.05."
"Moreover, the minimum of surface roughness value was obtained with 800 m/min of cutting speed, 0.05 mm/tooth of feed rate and 0.6 mm of depth of cut which result 0.142 of Ra."
