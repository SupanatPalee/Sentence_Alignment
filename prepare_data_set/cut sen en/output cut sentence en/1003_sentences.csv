The objectives of this research were to study and analyze the production processes of aromatic coconuts in order to improve and enhance production efficiency suitable for businesses.
The study began from transporting coconuts to the first production process through the final 12 workstations and examined which workstations should be adjusted and improved by simulating all 12 workstations with FlexSim Program.
This program is used to estimate the production processes in the future.
"With this simulation program, factories do not have to invest their money to improve or develop future workstation model from the current one."
The analysis and enhancement of this study revealed that three processes could increase the production efficiency and decrease working times by 39.58% compared with the present operation.
