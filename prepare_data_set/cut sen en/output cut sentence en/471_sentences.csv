"This research aims to analyze the importance of both freight transportation and passenger transportation, and to compare the significance of factors in freight transportation and passenger transportation in the special development zone which consists of Songkhla, Phatthalung, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Trang and Krabi, using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)."
"The research findings indicate that, overall, the five provinces have similar importance placed on both freight transportation and passenger transportation, except for Nakhon Si Thammarat, which gives higher priority to passenger transportation."
"On the other hand, Songkhla gives significantly more emphasis on freight transportation compared to passenger transportation, almost twice as much."
"When comparing the factors related to freight transportation in all five provinces, they prioritize transportation by road, followed by telecommunications and information technology respectively."
"When comparing the importance of factors in passenger transportation overall, it is observed that air transportation is given the highest priority."
"This is because the area is relatively far from Bangkok, and passengers tend to prefer air travel."
"Meanwhile, rail transportation focuses on providing local train services due to the lower pricing."
"As for water transportation, it primarily caters to travelers covering shorter distances."
"In practice, this area places more emphasis on water transportation for short-distance travel and provides a competitive advantage in this regard."
