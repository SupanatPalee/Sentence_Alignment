The objective of this research is to study the strength of terracotta ceramics containing plant ash as an ingredient and compare the difference in strength between terracotta ceramics without plant ash and those with plant ash mixed with them.
"The determined raw materials were Thalekaew clay, rice husk ash, rubber ash, and corn stalk ash."
"The researchers categorized the samples into three groups using purposive sampling, prepared and weighed the materials, ground, and mixed them together."
"After that, they formed those samples by pressing in a mold and burned them at the temperature of 1,100 degrees Celsius."
The research results revealed that terracotta ceramics made from Thalekaew clay exhibited a strength of 148.5 kilograms per square centimeter.
"With plant ash mixed in the raw materials, terracotta ceramics with 25 percent corn trunk ash showed the highest strength of 288.0 kilograms per square centimeter; terracotta ceramics with 12.5 percent rubber wood ash showed the highest strength of 216.7 kilograms per square centimeter; and terracotta ceramics with 2.5 percent rice husk ash yielded the highest strength of 79 kilograms per square centimeter."
"When comparing the strength values of terracotta ceramics made from Talay Kaew clay, and those mixed with rice husk ash displayed lower strength than those containing rubber wood ash and corn trunk ash, which revealed higher strength."
"These strength values varied based on the number of chemical components in each type of plant ash, the burning temperature, the forming process, and the amount of plant ash in the mixture."
"In summary, the mixture mentioned above can develop to be actual products."
"In addition, the obtained information is useful for future research endeavors."
