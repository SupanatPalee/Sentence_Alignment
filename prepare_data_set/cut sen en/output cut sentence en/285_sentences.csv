Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the popular problems in the transportation and logistics industry.
"With various types of constraints being difficult to solve, VRP with time windows (VRPTW) has received a large amount of attention from researchers."
"Usually, the objective of VRPTW is to specify the routes for the vehicles such that the total transportation distance is minimized."
This study proposes an Artificial Bee Colony Optimization with Adaptive Local Search (ALABCO) for VRPTW.
"In this method, the local search method is adapted to improve the quality solution that adapted for escaping the local optima."
The repair procedure is used for changing infeasible solutions that exceed capacity and violate time windows to feasible solutions.
The proposed method has been tested in Solomon instances in different problems and compared to other existing algorithms.
The results show that the proposed method is effective in solving problem.
