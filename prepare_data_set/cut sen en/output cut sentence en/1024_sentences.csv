This research is a study that uses situational models to help solve the problem of various unstable factors in raw sugar production.
For increase production Find the right amount of production resources.
and resulting in the highest production efficiency.
Raw sugar production is a difficult and complicated process.
It is a big industry and generates a lot of income for Thailand by exporting sugar to sell abroad.
Which has a continuous increase in demand.
Changing the production line to increase the production potential is costly.
"Therefore, it is imperative to calculate appropriate resources before making any real improvements."
This research uses real data from a sugar factory in the North.
"The research was conducted as a guideline in the simulation for a period of 2 working days, by performing 100 iterations in order to calculate the number of chests and adjust the number of pots sets accordingly."
"As a result, the production capacity was increased by 298.16%."
