The research proposed the mechanical parts designed by Machine design and Fluid mechanics to make the pepper cleaner machine shaker by vibration for cleaning the peel of pepper seeds to produce white pepper.
"Design machine parts determined the sizing of the smallest that can work effectively, such as camshaft for kicking vibrating tray and sizing of the cleaning pipe."
"Machine parts are important to the designed variables and most importantly, the sizing of the motor and the sizing of the pump."
This affects the long-term cost of electricity throughout the life of the machine.
"If the designer uses trial and error, it doesn’t take into account the principle of machine design and fluid mechanics."
"If the motor is smaller the vibrating tray of the machine can’t be moving, but the bigger can be very costly."
The design separated two parts with the lowest flow rate of water injected to the pepper seed.
"Designed for a production rate of at least 200 kg/hr, the camshafts, pulley and gear to final determine sizing of motor."
Result of the experiments were compared between electricity cost by machine design with the trial and error is the size of the motor cost at the time of use of various machines.
