The aim of this research was to reduce a parcel delivery time for an XYZ company using a simulation method due to lack of an express delivery service for customers every day.
The essential problem data of an XYZ company were collected for simulation modeling by using ARENA software.
"The parcels in this model were from numerous locations including a parcel distribution center, contractual customers, and a counter service at an XYZ company."
"After classifying process, all parcels were delivered to the customers in various zones including DB1, DB2, and DB3 by motorcycles or trucks."
Input data and cycle time of the developed model were validated and verified before conducting the experiments.
Experimental results indicated that the cycle time after increasing two workers in the classification process can be improved by 2.58%.
"Moreover, the average number of times for late parcel delivery to customers also decreased to be 1.16 times per day, or 77.6% of improvement."
