"This research aimed to study the level of knowledge, behavior of agrochemical uses and awareness of the dangers and its effects on agrochemical use among farmers in Muang District, Bang Krathum District, Wang Thong District, Bang Rakam District, Noen Maprang District and Phrom Phiram District, Phitsanulok Province."
A questionnaire was used as a tool to collect data from 400 farmers with a convenience sampling method.
The results showed that the farmers had a perception related to agrochemical use and its dangers with 52.75%.
"The information source of farmer perception was most received from agrochemical retailers, 72.51%."
Most of the farmers had a moderate level of knowledge on agrochemical use and its dangers with 49.00%.
Agrochemicals use and prevention behavior of farmers was at a moderate level (x̄=2.28±0.13).
"The farmer awareness of the dangers from agrochemical use was at a high level (x̄=4.18±0.05), which they were being most aware of the impacts on themselves (x̄=4.44±0.62), followed by awareness of the impacts on the environment (x̄=4.06±0.67) and awareness of the impacts on consumers (x̄=4.05±0.72), respectively."
"Therefore, promoting the correct knowledge, understanding and proper practices toward agrochemical use and prevention will lead to a reduction in the rate of sickness from rice farming and may be able to reduce the impact on consumers and the environment."
