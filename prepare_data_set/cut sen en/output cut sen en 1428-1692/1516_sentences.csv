"Nowadays, Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) the group of biopolymer has been intensively interested since they possess biodegradable efficiency as well as highly similar characteristic to petrochemical plastic."
"In this study, ten PHAs producing bacteria were screened from cassava starch wastewater using Sudan black B (SBB) dying technique."
Only 10 isolates were subsequently identified through the 16S rDNA sequencing analysis followed by phylogenetic relationship evaluation.
"The results revealed that they were successfully located into three bacterial genera including Bacillus, Enterobacter, and Sporosarcina."
"Interestingly, the molecular identification profile of KR_M9 was typically related to the strain Sporosarcina luteola, which has not been reported concerning to PHAs accumulation."
"Hence, it could be classified as the novel PHAs producing bacteria with attention to the further quanlitative and quantitative analysis of PHAs production."
