This research presents the use of IoT technology in the development of a prototype indoor air quality measurement system called NMU-AQI.
"To the standard, it consists of a total of 7 sensors to measure, including temperature, relative humidity."
"Carbon dioxide concentration Carbon Monoxide Concentration Airborne particulate matter less than 2.5 microns or PM 2.5, ozone gas and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) with a microcontroller to take readings from the sensor based on the Real Time Operating System (RTOS) to aid in processing."
Result of receiving data from various sensors As well as transmitting the data obtained from the sensor through the NB-ioT to the server to store the data in the database and process the data.
For displaying the sensor values ​​through a developed web application.
It can support NMU-AQI connection and display of multiple prototype devices simultaneously.
"In the case of installation in a variety of locations which can bring the sensor values ​​of each NMU-AQI to be displayed and compared in different values ​​according to the need by selecting the installed location The preliminary results found that Able to measure indoor air quality for all 7 units, the values ​​obtained are consistent and do not exceed the abnormality with indoor air quality standards."
The proposed system can be used in recording applications.
Analyze data and view trends in indoor air quality.
