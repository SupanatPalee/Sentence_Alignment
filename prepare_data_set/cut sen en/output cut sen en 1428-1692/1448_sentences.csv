High-altitude balloons (HABs) have the capability to provide platforms for different scientific mission.
"These large helium-filled balloons are released at the ground level with payload attached, climbing to an altitude of stratosphere."
The balloons then burst and the payload return to earth via parachute.
The payload and science data are then recovered.
"Consequently, HAB mission operation requires an accurate and reliable methodologies, in order to accomplish the mission successfully."
"This research work and study focus on two major aspects 1) determining procedure of balloon ascent that consists of design and find optimal sequence of maneuvers flight plan,Â  flight path analysis/predictor as well as parachute design , and 2) designing and implementing a real-time transmission system for communication means and autonomous tracking means.This research is part of KMITL CubeSat Project that has an ongoing activities of HAB mission for the purpose of carrying out experiment in near space condition."
