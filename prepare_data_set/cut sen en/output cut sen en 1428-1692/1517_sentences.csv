Recently biaxially polypropylene (BOPP) film or micro-perforated film was developed to create a modified atmosphere to physically extend the shelf-life of fresh-cut produces.
"However, the size of microhole was 80 micron which is bigger than the size of typical microorganism, thus the biological contamination from the air may occur."
"This research, therefore, aimed to study the possibility of microbial contamination via the hole of micro-perforated film The experiment was conducted by pouring plate count agar in the tray and sealed with micro-perforated films of different pore numbers, 0 holes (BOPP-0H), 5 holes (BOPP-5H) and 80 holes (BOPP-80H)."
The trays were incubated at 25 ºC and 8 ºC (open and close refrigerator) for 10 days.
The number of airborne microorganisms was also examined by settle plate method.
"The result showed that the number of microbes found in the tray related to that of airborne, especially when stored at 25 ºC which had higher contamination of airborne microorganisms than at 8 ºC."
"Therefore, the microbes contaminated in the air could pass through the perforated film of 80-micrometer size."
This was due to the size of the hole bigger than the cell and spore of microorganism.
"In addition, the tray covered with BOPP-80H had higher microbial contamination than that with BOPP-5H."
"Whilst, the tray covered with BOPP-0H had no microbial colony."
"In order to prolong the storage life of the fresh cut produces using micro-perforated film, the packaging must be placed in the atmosphere with low airborne contamination to delay both physical and biological spoilage."
