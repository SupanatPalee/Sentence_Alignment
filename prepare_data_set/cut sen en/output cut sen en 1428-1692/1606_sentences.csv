The objectives of this research were detecting the Campylobacter jejuni using colorimetric of loop-mediated Isothermal amplification (LAMP) compared with the standard method.
"Thirty chicken samples were collected from markets in Muang district, Chanthaburi province, Thailand."
The results showed 13 samples of chicken meat were contaminated with C. jejuni.
"However, 17 samples were not found the contamination of C. jejuni and the lowest sensitivity of DNA detection was 364 fg Âµl-1."
The detection of specificity for other bacteria was found that the primers did not show any cross-reactivity with other pathogenic bacteria.
"The standard method was compared with the LAMP DNA method, it was shown that both methods had the sensitivity, specificity and 100 percent accuracy."
"The detection kit has been developed for easy to use, comfortable, rapid and accuracy in the diagnosis of C. jejuni."
"Moreover, this test kit can be used for detection in the field for surveillance of Campylobactor spp."
in poultry products.
