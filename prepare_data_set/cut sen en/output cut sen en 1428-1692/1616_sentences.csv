"The abundance of fireflies was conducted monthly during February 2018 to January 2019 in the mangrove forest at Welu wetland, Chanthaburi province."
"The study area was divided into three study stations of which was separated into two parts, left and right."
The adult fireflies perching and flashing on all display trees were photographed and counted for abundance.
Some physical factors of their habitats were investigated.
"The result showed the significant difference of the abundances between the study stations (P<0.001), but no differences among monthly abundance were observed."
"The left part of the 1st station held the most abundance with high dissolved oxygen (DO) and low water temperature, pH, and water salinity."
"Meanwhile, the left part of the 3rd station was the lowest abundance with the lowest DO and high water temperature, pH and water salinity."
"Nonetheless, no correlation between the abundance of fireflies and some physical factors of their habitats was exhibited."
