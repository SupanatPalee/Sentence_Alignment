"The aim of this research was to develop a composite formula of natural rubber sponge mixed passion fruit peel charcoal powder suitable for the production of cushions using the design of experiment was a 2k full factorial design with 2 factors, that the quantity of sodium silicofluoride and the quantity of passion fruit peel charcoal powder."
"The tested ratios of sodium silicofluoride to passion fruit peel charcoal were 1 : 1, 0.5 : 15, 0.75 : 10, 0.5 : 5, and 1 : 15 grams, respectively."
"The study of factors affecting the density and shore 00 hardness properties, it was found that the quantity of passion fruit peel charcoal powder significantly affected the density."
"As for the factors affecting Shore 00 hardness, they were the quantity of sodium silicofluoride and the quantity of passion fruit peel charcoal powder."
The most suitable composite formula for producing natural rubber sponge mixed passion fruit peel charcoal powder was determined to be the ratio of 1:15 grams.
"This formula exhibited the highest density and Shore 00 hardness properties, which is suitable for use in the production of cushions, with a prediction accuracy of up to 83.18%."
"From the research results, it can be used as information for preparing natural rubber sponge mixed passion fruit peel charcoal powder to produce cushions made from natural materials, environmentally friendly and helps reduce the amount of passion fruit peel waste from processing"
