"In this article, we will discuss two iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations."
"that developed the concept of Gobabay-Javidi, Obama-Chebichev Method and Taylor series sequence analysis for convergence of a methodological Repeat steps 3 and present numerical example."
To show that the methodology we offer is more efficient.
Compared to other iteration methods in the same
