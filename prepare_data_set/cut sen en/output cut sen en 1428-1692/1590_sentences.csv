"Efficacy of platinum loaded titanium dioxide (Pt-TiO2)catalyst for degradation of methylene blue (MB) solution under ultraviolet (UV) light were successfully synthesized catalyst by coupling a hydrothermal method with an impregnation method with different ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt%Pt."
"Morphologies of samples were characterized by Xâ€“ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett- Teller (BET) specific surface area and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
The results indicated that all the samples were in the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2.
The Pt particles have oxidation numbers 0 +2 and +4 in the form Pt PtO and PtO2 distributed on the TiO2 surface.
The Pt-TiO2 efficacy was tested with 50 mL of 10 mg/L methylene blue (MB) solution under ultraviolet (UV).
It was found that the 1.0 wt% Pt-TiO2 showed the highest degradation efficiency in 150 min which able to increase 25% efficiency of TiO2.
