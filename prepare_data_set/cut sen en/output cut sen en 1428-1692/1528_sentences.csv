The purpose of this research was to compare the feedforward active noise control and feedback active noise control using to reduce noise in industrial plants.
The results showed that the feedforward control system could reduce 20.4 dB at 80 Hz whereas the feedback control system could reduce the sound level to 15 dB at 63Hz.
"The target band of the research feedback control system at 80 Hz could reduce noise 14.5 dB, which was satisfactory."
"Thus, both methods could be used in industrial plants."
Applications and limitations for this research were also discussed.
