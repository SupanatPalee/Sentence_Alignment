Abstract The objective of this research is to study the appropriate formula of kha nom thong muan from paka-umpoul defatted rice bran flour to develop as a snack to add fiber.
This study was done by planning a complete randomized design (CRD).
"The amount of paka-umpoul defatted rice bran flour and wheat flour was substituted at 5 levels of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 percent."
Five product formulations were obtained when evaluated.
"Sensory quality by quasi-trained consumer satisfaction test, 30 people."
"It was found that the consumers accepted the overall preference the most was formula 3, which uses the amount of paka-umpoul defatted rice bran flour instead of wheat flour, 20 % received the highest score, with an average score of 7.82 on the level of liking."
"The quality of chemical, physical and microbiological was then studied."
The quality of kha nom thong muan from paka-umpoul defatted rice bran flour from the accepted formula (formula 3) compared with the basic formula (formula 1) showed that the chemical quality was the fat and ash content.
"They were statistically different at the 95 % confidence level and found that dietary fiber 2.16 %, gamma-oryzanol 0.031 % and antioxidant 19.05 %, which were not found in the basic formula (formula 1)."
"Physical quality in terms of color, there was a statistically significant difference at 95% confidence level."
The amount of oil extracted rice bran flour decreased the brightness (L*) value darken.
And the microbial quality was in the Thai community product standard: Thai dessert (TCPS.1/2009).
