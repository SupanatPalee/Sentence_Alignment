"Contamination from heavy metals is the mosThe results showed that concentrations of Zn, Cu, Fe, and Pb in water were 0.001-4.72 mg/l, 0.0001-6.35 mg/l, 0.0003-0.018 mg/l and 0.005-7.07 mg/l, respectively, in soil sediment were 1.98-19.44 mg/kg, 0.004-1.62 mg/kg 1.01-1.77 mg/kg and 3.68-14.22 mg/kg, respectively."
t significant problem of environmental pollution worldwide.
"This study aims to analyze the concentrations of heavy metals contaminating in water, sediment and fish in Lam-Pai-Mat wetland, Burirum province."
The samples of water and sediment were collected in six stations with three replicates.
"The fish samples were collected and the fish organs including muscle, intestine and gill were carefully dissected."
"The heavy metals namely, zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) all samples were quantified, and the heavy metals accumulated in various organs of the fish samples were compared."
"Reviewing concentrations of the metals, all heavy metals except Cd concentration in water showed values exceeding the standard level, whereas the concentration of 4 heavy metals showed values not exceeding the standard level."
"The heavy metal in fish organs showed in the following order of gill>intestine> muscle in Zn and Cu, and intestine> gill> muscle in Cd and Pb."
The accumulations of Cd and Pb in the muscle of all fish species showed the values exceeding the standard level.
The bioconcentration factor values of the heavy metals in fish appeared in order of Cd>Zn>Pb> Cu.
