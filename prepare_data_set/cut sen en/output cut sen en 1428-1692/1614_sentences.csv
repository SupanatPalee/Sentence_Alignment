"The present study determines the total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC), antioxidant and antibacterial activities from the ethanol extract of four wild edible mushrooms bought from the community market in Loei Province: Boletus sp., Boletellus cf."
"emodensis, Pulveroboletus sp."
and Tylopilus sp.
"The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were evaluated by using Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride colorimetric methods, respectively."
The result indicated that the extract of Boletus sp.
"extract showed the highest of TPC and TFC, which was 61.69±0.35 mg GAE/g extract and 54.45±0.93 mg RUE/g extract, respectively."
"The antioxidant activities of the extracts were investigated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods."
It was found that Boletus sp.
extract exhibited the highest antioxidant activities.
"The IC50 value by DPPH and ABTS assay were 0.26±0.01 and 1.33±0.07 mg/ml, respectively and the FRAP assay exhibited antioxidant value of 33.14±0.29 FeSO4/g extract."
"In addition, the antibacterial activity was tested by disc diffusion method."
The Boletus sp.
"extract inhibited Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris at concentration of 5 mg/ml."
"In conclusion, four selected wild bee mushroom will be considered as a source of beneficial bioactive compounds and nutritious food."
