Passion fruit seeds are a waste of industrial production of passion fruit juice which are a source of several biomolecules such as carbohydrate protein lipid and fiber.
The aim of this research was to investigate the optimal conditions of oil extraction from the passion fruit seeds by solvent and ultrasound-assisted extraction (50/60 Hz) and to assess of oil properties for biodiesel production feedstock.
"The experiment was performed to examine the type of solvent as ethyl acetate, hexane, petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol and methanol, passion fruit seed to solvent ratio as 1 : 4, 1 : 5, 1 : 6, 1 : 8, 1 : 10, and 1 : 12, extraction time as 10, 15, 20, 25,and 30 min and extraction temperature as 30, 40 50 and 60 ◦C."
"The optimal conditions were ethyl acetate, passion fruit seed to solvent ratio of 1 : 12, extraction time of 25 min and extraction temperature at 30◦C, and the highest extracted oil yield was 23.36 % (wt./wt."
"), and kinetic viscosity of 53.60 mm2 s-1, density of 0.92 kg l-1 and free fatty acid of 0.54%."
The passion fruit seed oil has enough qualification and a potential to be used as biodiesel feedstock
