"In this work, ultraviolet (UV) sensing properties of ZnO nanostructures were investigated and compared to ZnO nanostructures embedded with gold nanoparticles."
"Firstly, zinc films were thermally oxidized to form ZnO nanostructures at 700Â°C for 10 hours."
"To form gold nanoparticles embedded ZnO nanostructures, gold nanoparticles were embedded onto the surface of ZnO nanostructures by photoreduction of HAuCl4."
ZnO nanostructures and gold nanoparticles embedded ZnO nanostructures were then fabricated as UV sensor with active area of 1 mm2.
Au electrodes were patterned on the sensing layer by screen printing of electrical conductive gold paste.
"Finally, UV sensing properties were investigated of UV illumination (365 nm) and a 10 V bias."
The result of UV sensing investigation showed that embedding gold nanoparticles onto ZnO nanostructures and green light illumination (532 nm) caused to improve the sensor repeatability.
"In addition, the sensor recovery of gold nanoparticles embedded ZnO nanostructures and green light illumination seems to have lower recovery time than other cases due to the faster rate of charge transfer from embedded gold nanoparticles to ZnO nanostructures."
"Accordingly, the improvement of sensor repeatability and recovery time can be explained in terms of a charge transfer process by considering the surface plasmon resonance effect of gold."
