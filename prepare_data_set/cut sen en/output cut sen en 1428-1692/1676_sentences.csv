"Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi (Breda), a beautiful small potted orchid belongs to the genus  Phalaenopsis."
It is commonly used as a breeder in the production of hybrid orchids.
Production of Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi hybrids using self-pollination and cross-pollination with four types in different colors and patterns of flowers about 16 pairs of hybrids by hand pollination was investigated.
The production of Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi hybrids was observed about eight pair of hybrids (56.28%).
"One pair of hybrid and seven pair of hybrids were produced from self-pollination and cross-pollination by hand pollination, respectively."
Age of hybrid pods was about 141 days and size of pods was about 3.4 cm in length x 1.0 cm in width after hand pollination.
"Seeds of Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi hybrids were germinated into protocorms on the VW agar medium (1949) supplemented with 150 ml/l coconut water, 20 g/l sucrose and pH 5.2 after 16 days of sowing in the dark at 25±2oC."
"Protocorms of Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi hybrids developed into plantlets with well-formed leaves and roots were cultured on modified VW agar medium supplemented with 150 ml/l coconut water, 100 g/l banana, 1 g/l activated charcoal and 20 g/l sucrose at pH 5.2 for 120 d at 25±2oC under light condition for 16 h/day."
