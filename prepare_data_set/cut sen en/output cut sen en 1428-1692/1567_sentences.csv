The purposes of this research were to study the process of the fiber extraction and study the properties of Sugar Palm peduncle's fiber.
"Fiber extraction was investigated into 3 experimental sets which used sodium hydroxide solution at concentrations of 5%, 10%, and 15%w/v respectively."
Each experimental set takes boiling time for 3 hours.
"The study revealed that it is most effective for extracting Sugar Palm peduncle's fiber to use a 10%w/v sodium hydroxide solution with the yield of fiber 43.21+0.30%, cellulose 41.71+0.35% hemicellulose 18.49+0.98%, lignin 2.94+0.07%, yarn size (Ne) 8.65+0.05, tensile strength (gram-force) 1,256.32+43.75 and elongation at break point 17.75+0.43%."
The peduncle fibers are 50 µm in diameter.
"The Sugar Palm peduncle’s fiber is characterized by long fiber, rough surface and large size."
"Therefore, Sugar Palm peduncle’s fibers are suitable to be used in the development of decorative or decorative textile products to create a unique identity for community products rather than being used to develop into apparel products."
