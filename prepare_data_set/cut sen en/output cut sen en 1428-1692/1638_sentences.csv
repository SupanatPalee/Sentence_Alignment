"The aim of this research was to compare the growth of Monascus purpureus TISTR 3090, Pyricularia grisea isolate PG002-12 and Rhizopus oligosporus on modified potato dextrose agar media prepared by using fruits of eight plants species; Diospyros decandra Lour, Muntingia calabura, Flacourtia jangomas (Lour.)"
"Raeusch,Elaeocarpus hygrophilus Kurz, Phyllanthus emblica, Moringa oleifera Lam, Ficus carica andMorinda citrifolia asa substitute of potato."
"Fruits were collected from Sounpapunmaihayak, Pibulsongkram Rajabhat University."
"After inoculation, the seeded plates were incubated at room temperature for 1-10 days."
The fungal growth were then evaluated by measuring fungal colony diameter.
The results showed that media mixed with Moringa oleifera Lam agar promoted the growth of M.purpureus TISTR 3090 and provided 52 0.23 mm (p≥0.05) colony diameter in 10 days.
Ficus carica agar promoted the growth of R.oligosporus providing 84.61.31 mm (p≥0.05) colony diameter in2 days.
Media of Moringa oleifera Lam also promoted the growth of P.grisea PG002-12 and providing 643.89 mm(p≥ 0.05) colony diameter in 4 days.
"In contrary, Phyllanthus emblica agar inhibited the growth ofP.grisea PG002-12 and providing 30.6 0.84 mm (p≥0.05) colony diameter."
