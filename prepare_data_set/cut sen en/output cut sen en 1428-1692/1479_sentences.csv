"The objectives of this research were to study the effects of drying methods (freeze, microwave and hot air drying) and conditions (low, medium and high) on yield, beta-carotene and lycopene content of gac aril powder."
"Gac aril was dried using a freeze-dryer under different drying conditions: low, medium and high (where the second stage of temperatures were 40, 50, and 60 °C) with a constant pressure and drying time (0.05 mbar and 120 min, respectively)."
"Gac aril was dried using a microwave oven under different drying conditions: low (using 480 W microwave power for 15 min), medium (using 560 W microwave power for 13 min) and high (using 640 W microwave power for 11 min)."
"Gac aril was also dried using a hot air oven under different conditions:  low (hot air temperature of 60 °C for 540 min), medium (hot air temperature of 70 °C for 480 min) and high (hot air temperature of 80 °C for 420 min)."
"It was found that gac aril dried using a freeze dryer under medium and high conditions resulted in the insignificant difference of yield, beta carotene, and lycopene content (p≥0.05) with the highest value."
Freeze drying of gac aril at medium condition using lower drying temperature resulted in lower energy consumption than at a higher condition.
"Therefore, the optimal method and drying condition of gac aril was freeze drying at medium condition (using a second stage drying temperature of 50 °C) which gave the highest yield (21.46%), and highest beta-carotene and lycopene content (10.19 and 1.98 mg/g dry weight, respectively)."
