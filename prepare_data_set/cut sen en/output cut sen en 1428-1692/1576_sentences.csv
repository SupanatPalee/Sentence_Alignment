Rice disease caused by fungi is very devastating to the rice yield.
"The objective of this research is to study diversity of fungi on rice variety Phitsanulok 2 in Nongklab, Sawankhalok, Sukhothai province."
Thirteen rice samples were collected from the field in two sampling times.
"Isolation of the fungi has been done by using tissue transplanting technique on PDA medium, then transferred fungal hyphal tip to new petri dish."
"Totally 43 isolates of fungi have been obtained, where 39 isolates are sporulated and 4 isolates are non-sporulated ones."
"Identification of the fungi was done based on morphological characteristics of fungal colony, growth characteristics of mycelium and spore production."
Microscopic characteristics of fungi were then examined under compound microscope using slide culture technique.
Generic name of each fungus was specified by comparing the information with relevant documents.
"Identification results showed that sporulated fungal isolates are belong to the following genera viz Alternaria, Aspergillus, Bipolaris, Curvularia, Nigrospora and Scopulariopsis, while non-sporulated isolates were classified as unidentified mycelia-sterilia."
The dominant fungal genera found in this study are Curvularia spp.
"(11 isolates; 25.58%), Nigrospora spp."
(10 isolates; 23.26%) and Aspergillus spp.
"(8 isolates; 18.60%), respectively."
