"The main objectives of this research were to study species diversity, abundance and similarity of birds in studying site for making ecotourism seasonal calendar."
"The data was carried out by field survey about bird species along mudflat, salt fields and aquaculture sites from August 2018 - July 2019."
"The data was analyzed to find out species diversity, abundance and similarity of birds."
"The study found that there were 10 orders, 26 families and 69 species of birds."
The highest number of bird species was 29 bird species in order Charadriiformes.
The highest number of 51 bird species was found in the salt field areas.
It was 2.77 according to Shannon Diversity Index (H’).
The salt field areas were suitable in terms of foods and resting areas for shorebirds and seabirds.
"According to abundance index, 10 bird species were in level 5 of abundance."
It was 14.49 percent of all birds.
The similarity index between bird species in salt fields and aquaculture sites was 0.667.
"In term of bird seasonal status, 28 resident birds, 8 resident and migratory birds and 33 migratory birds were found."
"In term of threatened species, 6 bird species were Near-threated (NT) namely Painted Stork, Black-tailed Godwit, Eurasian Curlew, Curlew Sandpiper, Red Knot and Red-necked Stint."
Great Knot was Endangered (EN).
Migratory birding is available in bird migratory season from August- May every year.
"So, the community should conserve bird habitat in order to let shorebirds and seabirds in the salt fields during the high tide."
The salt fields in Bang Kaew Sub-district can be developed to be birding sites for eco-touring and local knowledge resource programs because the birds are the indicators of natural balance and richness of foods in ecosystem.
