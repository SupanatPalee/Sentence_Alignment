"The research objectives were to study the relationship between meteorological factors and the concentration of PM and simulate the suitable model to predict the future average PM10 concentration in Na Phra Lan, Saraburi."
"In this study, a 10 year period (2006 - 2015) in PM10 data was analyzed by using statistical analysis."
"The results indicate that air pressure, relative humidity, rainfall, air temperature and wind speeds were significant relationship with concentration of PM10, with r = 0.838, 0.581, 0.488, 0.440 and 0.402 respectively."
"Multiple regression analysis shows that air pressure, wind speeds and rainfall could explain variation in concentration of PM approximately 74.90 percent at the 0.05 level statistically significant."
"Moreover, it shows that low wind speeds, low temperature, low humidity and low rainfall promote higher concentration of PM especially during the dry season."
"When the weather turns cold and humidity level drop, the concentration of PM10 has a maximum level regularly every year."
