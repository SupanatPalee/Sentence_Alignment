The research was to study root rot and stem rot of durian disease from Phytophthora palmivora.
"A total of 20 samples of durian disease symptoms were collected from Khao Khitchakut District and Kaeng Hang Maeo District, Chanthaburi Province, and 12 samples of P. palmivora and 8 samples were not detected."
The characterisation of P. palmivora colony morphology was tested by slide culture was found that the isolated had a rosette colony.
Light microscopy showed that sporangium was ovoid.
"When cultured on carrot agar, it grew well."
The analysis of P. palmivora by Loop-Mediated Isothermal amplification (LAMP) Method combined with dipstick DNA biosensor was found to detect 12 sample.
The sensitivity of LAMP for P. palmivora detection was found that the lowest concentration was 10-5 ug/ml.
The detection of specificity primer to showed no cross-reactivity with other fungal.
The analytical method are specificity to P. palmivora.
"The LAMP specific, but it did not detect another fungus."
"Therefore, the analysis of P. palmivora in durian using LAMP technique with dipstick DNA biosensor was a rapid method."
"It was used for the analysis of P. palmivora with high accuracy, easy use, without expensive tools, within 60-90 minutes and using very little DNA volume."
The diagnosis of infection can be analyzation to rapidly and efficiently this technique can be used to monitor and control the spread of disease.
