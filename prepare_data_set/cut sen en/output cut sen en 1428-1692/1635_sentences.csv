Tong taek (Baliospermum solanifolium (Burm.
)Suresh) is a local herb in a family of Euphorbiaceae that is important to traditional medicine for treatment or relief of some illnesses.
A few reports of the correlation between its antioxidant activity and total phenolic contents were reported.
"Moreover, the study of anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity has not been reported previously."
"Therefore, the objective of this research is to study the antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, analyze the total phenolic contents, and investigate the AChE inhibitory activity from Tong taek leaves extracts prepared by a maceration method using an increasing polarity of solvents including hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively."
The crude methanolic extract showed the highest antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 0.48±0.02 mg/mL and total phenolic contents with a value of 117.82±2.32 mg GAE/g crude extract.
"For the AChE inhibitory activity testing, it was found that the crude ethyl acetate extract displayed the highest anti-AChE activity with an IC50 value of 62.47±1.47 µg/mL at the concentration of 2000 µg/mL."
"Then, the crude extracts exhibiting highest biological activities were further separated as fractions or semi-pure compounds by column chromatography to give four fractions (BSM1-BSM4) from the crude methanolic extract which were tested for the antioxidant activity."
"The fraction BSM2 and BSM4 showed the relatively good antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 1.75±0.02 and 1.89±0.02 mg/mL, respectively."
"Their total phenolic contents are 72.99±0.04 and 59.43±0.02 mg GAE/g crude extract, respectively."
Five fractions (BSEA1-BSEA5) separated from the crude ethyl acetate extract were evaluated on the anti-AChE activity.
"It was found that both BSEA3 and BSEA5 fractions displayed their anti-AChE activity higher than other fractions with IC50 values of 1.19±0.03 and 1.20±0.07 mg/mL, respectively."
These results can be used as further information supported for the isolation of bioactive compounds from B. Solanifolium leaves to be developed as a novel drug candidate for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
