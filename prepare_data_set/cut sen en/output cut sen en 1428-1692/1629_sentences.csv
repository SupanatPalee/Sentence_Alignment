The objective of this research was to study the effects of compost from hythane production from stillage and brewer’s yeast cells co-digested of organic materials on growth and yields of Chinese kale.
"The experiment design was a Completely randomized design (CRD) of 11 treatments with 15 replications; treatment 1; without fertilizer (control), treatment 2; chemical fertilizer, treatment 3; compost formula 1, treatment 4; compost formula 2, treatment 5; compost formula 3, treatment 6; compost formula 4, treatment 7; compost formula 5, treatment 8; compost formula 6, treatment 9; compost formula 7, treatment 10; compost formula 8 and treatment 11; compost formula 9 at Plant Science Field, Faculty of Food and Agricultural Technology, Phibulsongkram Rajabhat University."
"The result showed that the chemical fertilizer (treatment 2) could produce highest growth and yield of Chinese kale, as well as, number of leave, leave width, leaf length, plant height and fresh weight."
"The number of leave were 11.40 leave/plant, leave width were 14.54 cm, Leaf length were 16.52 cm, plant height were 25.14 cm and fresh weight were 112.90 g/plant."
The growth and yield of Chinese kale in treatment 9 (Compost formula 7) was second.
"While, the control treatment gave the lowest growth and yield of Chinese kale."
