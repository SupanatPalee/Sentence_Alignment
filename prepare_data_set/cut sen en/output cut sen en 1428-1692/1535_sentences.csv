"The research article presents the application of the Tinkercad program, specifically its Circuits sub-program, for examining the operational characteristics of RC circuits."
"This work focuses on the circuit's transient response, utilizing a time reference within the program for timekeeping in the experiments."
The experiment outlined in the article is divided into three parts.
The first part of the experiment aimed to measure the voltage across the capacitor in relation to time and the used capacitance.
This part confirms the property of changing the exponential function of the voltage across the capacitor.
The second part of the experiment focused on measuring the half-life of the circuit in comparison to the supply voltage and the used capacitance.
The results of this experiment confirm that the initial voltage value of the capacitor does not affect the circuit's half-life time.
"For the third part of the experiment, we measured the circuit's half-life time to analyze its electrical capacity by varying the resistance in the circuit."
"From the electrical capacity measurement experiment results, we found that the maximum error was equal to 1%."
Guidelines for using the research include experimental models and circuit-building techniques for teaching topics related to RC circuits.
It can also be modified to create a capacitance measurement system for capacitance sensors.
