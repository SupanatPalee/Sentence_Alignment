"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three different levels of Sappan water, namely 0 %, 50 % and 100% in Mamon cakes."
The results showed that the most accepted mammon cake was the one with 100% replacement with Sappan water.
The physical quality of the Mamon cake was studied.
"The results showed that the increase in the Sappan water had an effect on color values of L* since it reduced statistically (p≤0.05) 71.53, 65.80 and 60.10 respectively."
"Vice versa, the a* values of the cakes increased when replaced with the Sappan water 4.53, 5.56 and 7.33 respectively."
"The b* values of the cakes decreased 34.06, 28.06 and 26.60."
"The water activity (Aw) values increased as there was an increase of Sappan water 0.85, 0.86 and 0.86."
"In terms of texture analysis, hardness and adhesiveness were analyzed."
It was found that the Mamon cake with 100 % Sappan water replacement had the highest value 0.32 and 0.01 respectively.
The increase in Sappan water had a statistical effect on hardness (p≤0.05).
"When it was examined with a light microscope model Axio Lab.A1 for Materials with the standard magnification, it was found that the increase in Sappan water caused a firmer structure of the product."
