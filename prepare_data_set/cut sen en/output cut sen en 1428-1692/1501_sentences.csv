"This research aims to investigate the spatio – temporal distribution and trends of sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Thailand, which was retrieved from Aqua MOSID from January 2003 to December 2017 (15 years) using R programing and geoinformatic packages."
The results illustrated that the annual average sea surface temperature was normally between 29 to 31 °C.
"In addition, the sea surface temperature trend showed increasing trend (0.02 to 0.06 °C/year) depending on a location."
Much temporal variations in sea surface temperature were found in the upper Gulf of Thailand and along the coast of the lower gulf.
