This research aimed to determine the qualitative and quantitative of the pesticide residues in Sai Nam Phueng oranges and investigated the efficiency of four washing methods.
"The washing methods included soaking water, saline, vinegar and sodium carbonate, respectively."
The extracted samples by QuEChERS method were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/ Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/ Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques.
"The 3 groups of pesticide residues were found, 1) Ethion and Profenofos of Organophosphate groups, 2) 3-Hydroxy Carbofuran, Fenobucarb and Carbofuran of Carbamate groups and 3) Bifenthrin, Cyfluthrin and L-Cyhalothrin of Pyrethroid groups."
The significant was differed of the 4 washing methods effectiveness was showed at p 0.05.
Sodium carbonate washing method was the most effective regarded to eliminate pesticide residues of organophosphate group.
Saline washing was showed the most effective for carbamate group and vinegar washing method was most suitable for pyrethroid group.
"The results of analyzing the efficiency of four washing methods were specified to pesticide residues, which can be selected before consumption."
