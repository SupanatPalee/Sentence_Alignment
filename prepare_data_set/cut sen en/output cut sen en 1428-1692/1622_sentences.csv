The objective of this study was to study the diversity of fish species along the central area of Chi watershed until the end of Chi River in Surin Province.
"Fish samples were collected by using 2, 3, 4 and 5 centimeters net traps once a month and were surveyed between rainy season (May - September 2018) and winter (October - March 2019) in 2 stations."
It was found that there were 8 orders 19 families and 47 species of freshwater fish were recorded.
"Fish species in order Cypriniformes were the highest of 22 species, followed by order Perciformes, found 10 species and 7 species of order Siluriformes which 46.8, 21.3 and 14.9% respectively."
"The family Cyprinidae was dominant fish with 18 species, followed by the family Cobitoidae with 4 fish species."
"Herein, there were 3 alien species of freshwater fish were found, Hypostomus Plecostomus, an invasive alien species was only one fish species which could be recorded in this water source."
Two species of non-invasive alien species i.e.
Cyprinus carpio and Oreochromis niloticus were observed.
"In addition, Discherodontus ashmeadi was discovered as a vulnerable species."
"When considering the 2 stations (Mueang district and Tha Tum district, Surin Province), there were 31 species of fish found that have been widely spread throughout the season in both station."
The distribution of fish species in a small area that found only in Station 1 were Cyprinus carpio and found only Channa Lucius and Hemibagrus sp.
in Station 2.
"Throughout the study, it was found that in the winter the number of fish species was higher than the rainy season in both stations."
"For the dominant family species, the Station 2 area were of high diversity but the distribution of each species are not even and some sample are dominant more than other specimens in each collecting sites."
"In this survey, fish species in the Chi watershed are considered basic information on natural resources that are valuable to local communities, including agencies, organizations."
That can be used as tools for managing conservation plans and utilizing diversity of fish of the sustainability community.
