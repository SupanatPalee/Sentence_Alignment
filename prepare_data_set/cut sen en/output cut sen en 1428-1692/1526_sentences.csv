This research was studied the electricity generation and treatment efficiency from glycerol waste from transesterification process by single-chamber microbial fuel cell (SC-MFC).
"The SC-MFCs were inoculated with the heat pre-treated seed (1 mL) and the synthetic wastewater in fed batch mode at 37oC 1,000 ohms."
"The waste glycerol was varied concentration of 2,000 and 2,500 mg COD /L."
"The results showed that waste glycerol concentration of 2,000 and 2,500 mg COD/L can be obtained maximum current 5.76x10-2 mA and 2.82x10-2, respectively."
"Maximum total COD removal efficiencies from 2,000 and 2,500 mg COD/L were 75.22% and 80%, respectively."
These results suggested that SC-MFC is a potential technology for electricity generation and glycerol waste treatment.
