"In this research, the torrefaction of pine sawdust was investigated at 3 temperature levels, i.e., 250, 275 and 300 째C and reaction times of 30 min."
"The effect of the temperature severity on the mass yield and fuel properties of solid products was studied, namely, ultimate analysis, moisture and ash content, higher heating values, atomic ratio, including functional group analyses."
"The research found that as the temperature increased from 250 째C to 300 째C, the mass yield decreased from 86.35% to 62.63%, whereas the carbon content increased from 49.26% to 60.01% and the higher heating value increased from 19.64 to 24.54 MJ/kg."
"Due to the increase of carbon content and the decrease of oxygen and hydrogen content, the atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) and hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratios of pine sawdust torrefied at 300 째C decreased and possessed lignite-like qualities."
"Therefore, pine sawdust treated by torrefaction is suitable for use combined with other solid fuels, including replacing coal, in power plants."
