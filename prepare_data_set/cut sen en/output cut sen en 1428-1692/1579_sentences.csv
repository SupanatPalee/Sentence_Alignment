This research study aims to determine the effect of methanolic extract from Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M.
King & H. Rob leaves at different concentrations on inhibition of seed germination of Bidens pilosa L. and Chrysopogon aciculatus (Retz.)
Trin.
"The dried powder, which taken from the leaves of the C. odorata Soaked, was dissolved in methanol in the proportion of 10 grams of leaf powder per 100 ml of methanol."
The residue was then filtered and the solvent was evaporated by a vacuum evaporator.
"Methanolic extract from C. odorata leaves was prepared at various concentrations: 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 and 40,000 ppm."
Twenty seeds of each weed species were watered in a petri-dish on tissue paper and left at room temperature for 7 days.
The results indicated that all concentrations of methanolic extract from C. odorata leaves showed statistically significantly higher inhibition of seed germination of B. pilosa and C. aciculatus than the control group (P<0.01).
"The highest concentrations that can inhibit the seed germination of B. pilosa were 40,000 and 20,000 ppm, followed by concentrations of 10,000 ppm."
"The concentration that can inhibit the seed germination of C. aciculatus at the highest concentration was 40,000 ppm, followed by concentration levels 20,000, 10,000 and 5,000 ppm, respectively."
