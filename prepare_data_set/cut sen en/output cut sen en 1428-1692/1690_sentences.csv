This article introduces a restaurant valuables inspection system that utilizes AI technology and cameras to assist customers in identifying forgotten or missing items.
"Additionally, it incorporates a website for online table reservations, aiming to reduce queue waiting times and enhance customer convenience."
Customers can access the website to view items detected by the system.
This project leverages AI technology to increase security efficiency by employing the PHP language to develop a restaurant reservation website and MySQL to manage the database.
"The AI model was trained using Deep Learning techniques from the Roboflow website, achieving an average precision of 0.99616 and an average recall of 0.99726."
"Subsequent calculation of the F1-Score revealed that the model could accurately identify object types with an average of 0.995, or 99.5%."
