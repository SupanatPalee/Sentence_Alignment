The aim of research was to propose the estimator of population mean using dual to ratio cum product for post-stratified sampling.
This proposed estimator was modified from the estimator of Singh et al.
(2005).
Mean squared error of the proposed estimator was obtained.
The efficiency of this proposed estimator was compared with ratio cum product estimator by Tailor et al.
(2016) on the basis of mean squared error and relative efficiency.
The results revealed that the proposed estimator was more efficient than ratio cum product estimator by Tailor et al.
(2016).
"In additions, the theoretical of mean square error of the estimator were illustrated with numerical computation."
