"The objectives of this experiment was to  study the most suitable condition for stimulation of Kluai Nam Wa Khieo, Musa (ABB group)."
"The 3 continuous experiments were to compare the types of leaves, quantity and incubation period that could accelerate the ripening of banana ‘KLUAI NAM WA KHIEO’."
"It was found that curing with the same quantity and period, cassia leaves gave the bananas to ripen better than using leucaena leaves (Leucaena leucocephala) with the highest sweetness of 25.00 Brix, which was accepted by consumers."
"Furthermore, using 500 g cassia leaves resulted in green-pale yellow of banana peel."
The sweetness was 22.44 Brix and the minimum firmness was 2.70 N/cm2.
It was the most accepted treatment by consumers.
"Finally, the incubation banana with 500 g cassia leaves for 5 days gave the bananas peeled with a pale green-yellow color."
The highest sweetness was 23.66 Brix and the minimum firmness was 2.66 (N/cm2).
"However, consumers assessment showed that curing banana with 500 grams cassia leaves for 4 days was more accepted than the other experimental sets with statistical significance (p<0.05)."
