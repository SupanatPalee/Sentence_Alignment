Cynodon dactylonÂ (L.) Pers.
has properties to help heal wounds and can be used as a hemostatic drug.
"Therefore, the C. dactylon extracts is an effective substance developed into a hemostatic product."
"This study aims to study the botanical chemistry of C. dactylon extracts, including tannins and alkaloids in different solvents, developed formulas, water absorption, and stability tests of hemostatic gel patches containing C. dactylon extract."
"The results of the study showed that C. dactylon extract using fermentation with ethanol contains alkaloids and tannins, which indicate hemostatic properties."
The resulting C. dactylon extract can be critical in the hemostatic gel patches recipe.
It has also developed four formulations to obtain a stable gel patch.
"We found that formula D consists of C. dactylon extract, gelatin, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and water as a ratio 30 : 5 : 2 : 63 which can absorb and store the most water."
"The hemostatic gel patches containing C. dactylon extract did not affect the physical appearance, i.e., color, and odor at the end of the test."
"In addition, developing this gel patch recipe using a green solvent is suitable as an essential substance in developing this C. dactylon gel sheet."
The C. dactylon gel patch can also be used to release medicines and develop hemostatic products that can be sold on the market.
