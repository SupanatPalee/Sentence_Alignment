The key problem of Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum var.
formolongo) growing in the plots are non-homogenous growth which caused by abiotic factors and led to the effect of floral harvest.
This research aimed to study the development stage of the microspores from L. longiflorum var.
"formolongo that related to the different sizes of flower buds and to determine the sizes of flower buds that contained the tetrad microspores, which further developed to new embryoid."
The anthers of the flower buds with 1.00 - 2.10 cm length and the age of 70 - 75 days after planting bulbs were dyed with Acetocarmine 0.002 M concentration then detecting stage of meiosis cell division by using Squash technique.
It was found the size of flower buds during 1.90 - 2.10 cm length which contained significantly highest microspores in tetrad stage amount 18.78% at p< 0.05 when compared with other sizes.
It was the most appropriate development stage for further research of the pure line improvement from another culture.
