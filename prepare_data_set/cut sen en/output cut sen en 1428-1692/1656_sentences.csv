This research proposed of microwave launcher for pineapple dryer by using pyramidal horn antenna.
In the design of a pyramidal horn antenna to increase gain of microwave frequency from the magnetron excited through the waveguide launcher.
The small design microwave could be stimulate the transmission of high frequency or microwave frequencies through the waveguide to the dryer or cavity.
"The design of large-sized microwave drying cabinets, obtaining of increasing gain microwave sources were necessary to supported the work of large dry microwave designs."
"The design of the pyramidal horn antenna that is connected to the WR340 waveguide from the proposed design can be performed at 2.45 GHz frequency, which is Frequency that is allowed to be used for heating."
"The simulation of the proposed antenna with the software optimized, we found that of the gain antenna at 13.7 dB, and also an increase of 10.03 dB were compared to microwave transmission in the waveguides only."
