This research article deals with design and development of a simple harmonic motion experimental set with Arduino.
"The objectives are: 1) study the value of the spring-constant, the relationship between mass and spring-constant and the period of motion."
2) develop teaching experimental set for simple harmonic motion of spring-masses using Arduino.
"The experiment was done by hanging a spring-loaded mass of 100 200 250 and 300 g. respectively, to find the spring constant using Arduino."
It was found that the period from the measurement using Arduino was 4.29 2.14 1.50 and 1.25 seconds respectively.
"The spring-constant is 0.45 newton/meter and the spring constant from Hooke's law by hanging a spring-loaded mass of 150, 150, 200, 250 and 300 g. was found that the length of the spring was 1.56 4.00 6.26 8.53 and 10.83 cm."
respectively and the spring constant was equal to 0.46 Newton / meter.
From the experiment to find the constant value of the spring using Arduino and Hooke's law found that error not exceeding 2%.
