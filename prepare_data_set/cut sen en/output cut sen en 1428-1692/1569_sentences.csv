"This research was to study the soil quality of three pomelo varieties’s orchards including Thakhoi, Kaotangkwa and Thongdee varieties in Pho Prathap Chang Sub-district, Pho Prathap Chang District, Phichit province."
"Soil samples were randomly collected in 10 orchards of each pomelo variety, a total of 30 orchards."
The results showed that soil color of pomelo orchards was light brown to dark brown.
The soil textures were mostly silt loam.
Soil pH was slightly acidic with an average of 6.23±0.61.
The average moisture was 8.16±3.81%.
Soil organic matters were at moderately high to high levels with an average of 3.39±0.86%.
Nitrogen contents were at a moderate level with an average of 0.17±0.04%.
"The amounts of phosphorus were at a low level with an average of 7.48±4.60 mg/kg, and potassium contents were at a moderate level with an average of 86.24±9.31."
"Soil organic matter and potassium contents in the soil of the pomelo orchards were considered suitable for pomelo cultivation, while nitrogen and phosphorus contents were lower than the suitable criteria for growing pomelo."
"Therefore, farmers should regularly determine nitrogen and phosphorus contents in pomelo’s orchard soils to be basic information of nutrient management in pomelo’s orchard soils properly."
This will enable the soils to have the potential to further increase the pomelo productivity and quality.
