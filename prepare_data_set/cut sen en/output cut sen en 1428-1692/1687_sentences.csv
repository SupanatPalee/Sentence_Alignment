"The research aims to create a model for screening patients with kidney stones in the kidney, using images of patients diagnosed."
"A total of 6,454 images were collected from various hospitals in the city of Thakarpa, Bangladesh."
"The data was analyzed using the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM), using the 4 techniques of image classification: Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Random Forest."
"To test the performance of Image classification using Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, and F-measure."
The research found that the K-NN nearest neighbor is the most suitable for building a model to screen kidney stones effectively and efficiently in patients.
