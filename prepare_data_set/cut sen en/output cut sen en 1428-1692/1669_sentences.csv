The objectives of this project were 1) to development an augmented reality application of a solar system for hearing impaired students and 2) to study the satisfaction of users of the augmented reality application of a solar system for hearing impaired students.
The sample group consisted of 4 experts to evaluate the application’s performance and of 5 hearing impaired students from Setthasathien school to study the satisfaction of using the created application.
"The results showed 1) the overall efficiency of the augmented reality application of a solar system for hearing impaired students by experts’ opinion were at the highest level (  = 3.82, SD = 0.26), design (  = 3.80, SD = 0.25), content (  = 3.90, SD = 0.14), and usability (  = 3.75, SD = 0.31) 2)."
2).
"The use of the augmented reality application of a solar system for hearing impaired students was found to be satisfying at a high level (  = 3.5, SD = 0.15)"
