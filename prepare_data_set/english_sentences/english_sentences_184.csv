Weather radar has the ability to consistently measure rainfall promptly as it appears in a wide range of area and offer rainfall data of high resolution in both areal and time manner.
"Especially when used in coordinate with rainfall data from the automatic rain gauge, the accuracy is greatly increased."
"However, the errors in rainfall estimation of radar persist as a result of inappropriate relationship Z-R usage, that of adjustment of radar rainfall and ground rainfall, as well as that of diverse physical appearances of the rain that differ correspondingly to their distribution in each rainfall event."
"This study gathered 230 rainfall events, conducting between August 25, 2018 to August 31, 2020, comprising of hourly rainfall data from 174 automatic rain gauges and radar reflectivity of Takhli radar under its measuring radius of 240 km to analyze the appropriate rainfall estimation method for Takhli radar."
The result indicates that rainfall estimation that incorporate relationship Z-R and daily bias adjustment for each rainfall cluster categorized by radar reflectivity value is appropriate estimation method for Takhli radar.
This method reduces most of error from inappropriate relationship Z-R usage and that from adjustment of radar rainfall and ground rainfall in comparison to other methods those are taken into consideration.
"When comparing the proposed method to the rainfall estimation that employs relationship Z-R and daily variable in each rainfall cluster categorized by radar reflectivity value without bias adjustment, the proposed method improve accuracy in rainfall estimation to 2.85%, 5.77%, 1.88% and 32.90% considering from RMSE, MSE, MAE and BIAS, respectively."
