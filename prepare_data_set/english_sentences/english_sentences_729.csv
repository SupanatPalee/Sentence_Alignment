This paper deals with the determination of parameters of polyethylene foam using Curve Fitting Method.
This method is useful for calculating parameters from Stress-Strain relation obtained from uniaxial compressive test in case of large deformation.
Polyethylene foam is selected as specimens with 20-millimeter minimum thickness and contacted area is more than 2500 square millimeter.
ASTM D3574 type C is chosen to be testing standard.
"Since Polyethylene foam is assumed to be hyperelastic material, large deformation theory with strain energy function is applied to derive the equation obtained from engineering stress and strain."
Blatz-Ko hyperelastic model is used to identify a hyperelastic parameter as initial shear modulus from mechanical response using Curve-Fitting Method.
Result which is found in term of initial shear modulus of Polyethylene foam was satisfied.
"Which is hyperelastic material, those parameters describe the mechanical response under uniaxial compression testing, ASTM D3574 type C, Standard specification for testing."
The relation between compressive force and stretch is investigated.
Then the test data is calculated to the relationship between stress and strain and the result found in term of initial shear modulus is 34.230 kPa.
"Substitute Poisson ratio of this foam as 0.25 in Hookeâ€™s Law, modulus of elasticity is 85.577 kPa."
