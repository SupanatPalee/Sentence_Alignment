sentences
The objectives of a study for enhancing energy efficiency in pig farm were to enhance performance by using Economic principles for analysis worth of investment many methods.
"In this study, survey data in pig farm from 33 sample farms of Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency."
Studies have shown that fan motors have the highest percentage of energy consumption causing the most potential to increase energy efficiency consumption.
The study had 2 methods to solve the problem.
The results of the study of 2 methods had (1) Switching to high efficiency motors method.
The researcher has calculated the potential and saving energy arising of replacing standard electric motors with high efficiency motors.
"According to the comparison table, standard electric motor and high efficiency motor had an average saving of 7.6% per year."
Saving energy was depend on the number of hours worked per year and the load that the motor receives.
"When analyzing the investment by referring to high efficiency motor price standard for 10 years, the result is large farms and medium farms are the worth investment."
(2) Using of evaporative air conditioning systems method.
The researcher has calculated the potential and saving energy arising of installing evaporative air conditioning systems.
Can reduce energy consumption 20% of the motor.
"When analyzing the investment by referring to evaporative air conditioning system price standard for 10 years, the result is large farms are the worth of the whole investment."
The factors that affect the value are total motor power.
