"The objectives of this research were to study the care systems of Nam Dokmai Mangoes using General Agricultural Practice and Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), to compare the productivity such as quantity, quality and expenses, and to disseminate this research by training workshop for agriculturist grow mangoes in Sao Cha-Ngok subdistrict."
Three gardens of the Nam Dokmai mango cultivated area (12 trees/garden) were selected as experimental plot and control plot (General Agricultural Execute).
"The yield of mangoes from experimental plot (GAP) was 1,062 fruits, total weight 346.60 kgs, average fruit weight 323.70 grams whereas The yield of mangoes from control plots was 685 fruits, total weight 201.24 kgs, average fruit weight 282.11 grams."
"Therefore, the different yield was 377 fruits, total weight 145.36 kgs."
"The sales of Nam Dokmai mangoes from experimental plot (GAP) and control plot were 17,290 baht  and 7,043 baht, respectively."
"The caring cost of the experimental plot was higher than that of control plot about 4,362 baht."
"The profit of the experimental plot was higher than that of control plot about 5,884 baht."
"Therefore, if the agriculturist cultivated Nam Dokmai mangoes 5 acres, the profit would get more than 78,461 baht."
"Because if thinking in economics, the value that can be increased from cost reduction  from chemical fertilizers that will remain in the soil and the value of the carbon bag used to wrap the mango can be reused (80%)."
"From the training workshop to disseminate the knowledge of care systems Nam Dokmai mango for 29 agriculturists in SaoCha-Ngok, the agriculturist opinions showed that the assessment results had a good level of average opinion (4.05 ± 0.60) and the participants can apply the knowledge gained to take care mango garden that had the highest level (4.56 ± 0.51)."
The results concluded that the care system Nam Dokmai mangoes using GAP had the higher yield and higher quality than that using general agricultural practice.
"Because it is the result of care system by step-by-step care such as use effective fertilizer, good pest control, wrapping prevent the destruction of the disease which they are different from general agricultural practice that take care only a few steps, put chemical fertilizer or manure for some year, protect disease and insect in available period."
There were reasons don’t want to lose more money and don’t sure the output product.
"This research shows that if agriculturists using GAP system, they will be able to increase yields in both quantity and quality and increased revenue."
