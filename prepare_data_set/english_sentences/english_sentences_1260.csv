The aim of this research is to design a prototype of male dummy chest for motorcycle crash test.
The unique features of Thai ergonomic body sizes with an age range of the highest fatal rate and the Hybrid III 50th percentile male crash test dummy is primarily used for the criterion design.
A comprehensive experimental study of crush behavior of a prototype undergoing axial compressive loading is performed using a mutual procedure of cadaveric chest testing.
"For design criterion, at the largest chest deflection of 80 mm, the maximum acceleration of 38.43g and absorbed energy of 483.06 joules are considered in experimental results that show a good agreement with experimental data of other research."
The capability of energy absorption depends on impact velocities.
"In addition, definite crush behavior of this prototype is able to accurately assess an injury level under AIS 3+."
"For this reason, the first prototype of male chest dummy is particularly suitable for an assessment of a lower serious injury level in a motorcycle crash test."
