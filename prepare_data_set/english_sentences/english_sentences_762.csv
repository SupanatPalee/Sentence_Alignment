"This research aims to study the effect of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) and limestone powder (LP) on threshold chloride content, the depassivation time of steel and compressive strength of concrete containing GGBFS and LP."
"The GGBFS was used as a partial replacement of binder at the replacement percentage of 30%, 40%, 50% and 70% and LP was used to replace the binder at the replacement percentage of 5%, 10% and 15%."
The water to binder ratio of 0.50 and covering depth of 2 cm were used.
The results showed that the threshold chloride content and depassivation time of concrete containing GGBFS and LP was higher than that of cement-only concrete.
Concrete with GGBFS had lower threshold chloride content and longer depassivation time with increasing binder replacement content by GGBFS.
"The use of LP at 5% binder replacement in concrete containing GGBFS gave higher compressive strength of concrete, longer depassivation time of steel and higher corrosion resistance index of steel in concrete."
