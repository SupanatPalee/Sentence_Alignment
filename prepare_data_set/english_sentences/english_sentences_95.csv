"The purposes of this research were 1) to develop the fiber optic communication performance training kit, 2) to find the efficiency of the fiber optic communication performance training kit, and 3) to compare the post- learning achievement between the experimental group and the control group in computer networking system subject (Subject Code 3105-9004) in High Vocational Certificate, Office of the Vocational Education Commission.The sample groups consisted of 35 students in the 1st year from the branch of Electronics at Phrae Technical College who enrolled in computer networking system subject for the academic year 2019."
They were divided into 2 groups by simple random method which consisted of the experimental group of 14 students and the control group of 21 students.
The instruments used for data collection were: 1) the evaluation form for the fiber optic communication performance training kit; 2) the learning achievement test.
The statistics used to analyze the data were mean and standard deviation.
The hypothesis was tested with t-test dependent and t-test independent statistics.
The results of the research were as follows: 1) the development of the fiber optic communication performance training kit was in the highest levels.
"The average value was 4.68, 2) the developed fiber optic communication performance training kit was efficient at 82.07 / 80.71 which was according to the provided criteria, and 3) the post-learning achievement of the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group at 0.05."
