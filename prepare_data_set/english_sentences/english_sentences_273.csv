"This study simulated the operational situations within the empty-container yard of a seaport into the computer system, for the objective is to improve the yard performance."
"The case-study yard has used for storing the empty containers temporarily, so it is one of the international cargo transportation processes."
"According to the working process study of the case study, it was found that the average time in system of a tractor-truck is higher than the planned specified, and the truck must be wait for the operation of container management, affecting the yard performance."
"Therefore, a current situation model, which was verified for accuracy, has been created."
"Next, the ways of increasing performance have been determined as alternatives which are divided by two policies as follow: 1) the way requiring added investment (as 3 alternatives), and 2) the way requiring no investment (as 3 alternatives)."
"From the experimental result, it was found that the best of all simulations is the alternative no.3 with added investment requirement."
"As using this way, the performance has increased, for the average time in system reduces with 27.88%"
