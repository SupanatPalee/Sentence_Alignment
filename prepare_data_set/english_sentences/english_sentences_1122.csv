Eco-efficiency assessment in air pollution treatment by photocatalytic oxidation contributes to the application of effective air control pollution.
The purpose of this research is to study eco-efficiency assessment of removal efficiency of benzene by photolysis and photocatalytic oxidation using 5%TiO2/PLA-composite film which synthesized by blown film technique.
The result from SEM showed well dispersion of TiO2 on film.
"UV-VIS showed the band gap is 3.22 eV, band gap of anatase TiO2."
ATR-FTIR showed anatase TiO2 and PLA in the film.
"The result showed removal efficiency of benzene by photocatalytic oxidation and photolysis within 24 hours of reaction time are 44% and 9%, respectively."
"Benzene can be degraded to CO2 and H2O by photocatalytic oxidation and photolysis, was following the first order kinetic."
"The removal rate constants (k) were 0.0188 and 0.0133, respectively."
"The eco-efficiency was 0.346 and 0.007, respectively."
"In summary, the photocatalytic oxidation using 5%TiO2/PLA-composite film is suitable for removal benzene and high eco-efficiency."
