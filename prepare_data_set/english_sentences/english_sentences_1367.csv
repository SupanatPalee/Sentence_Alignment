"In this paper, heat transfer characteristics in the flow channel under stationary and rotating conditions were studied."
"The array of jets from 3 x 11 of orifice holes with diameter Dj = 5 mm with the inline arrangement was studied at pitch distance S/Dj = 4 and the impingement distance L/Dj = 2, 4 and 6."
"The jet flow was fixed with a Reynolds number of 10,000 and the rotation speed of the flow channel was varied between Ro = 0.0 - 0.0066 (or the speed of 400 rpm)."
The heat transfer was measured on the impingement surface using a Thermochromic Liquid Crystal (TLC) sheet to measure the temperature and calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient.
Results showed that the rotational condition affected the heat transfer characteristics due to the effects of Centrifugal and Coriolis forces on the jet flow and cross flow.
This caused the Nusselt number on the surface to be increase by 6.43 % for the case of leading side compared to that of the case of trailing side.
