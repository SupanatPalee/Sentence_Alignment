This research has focused on finding the appropriate conditions for the factors that affect the minimum surface roughness in the turning process using the design of experiments technique of the turning process of KCF guide pins with the automatic lathe.
"A two-factor factorial design, speed, and feed rate were investigated."
Both factors have been assigned three levels.
The effect of cutting variables (depth 0.1 mm) on the surface roughness was investigated.
The results from the experiment and the analysis of variance with a 95% confidence level showed that feed rate has much more influence on surface roughness than speed rate.
"The appropriate condition factors for speed and feed rate are 280 rpm and 0.08 mm per round, which show the minimum surface roughness is 0.739 Âµm."
