This research presents to develop ground calcium carbide residue (GCCB) and ground fine fly ash (GFFA) as a cementitious material for blend Portland cement type 1 (CT).
CT was partially replaced at 15% of GFFA by weight of cementitious materials.
"In addition, GCCB, GFFA and CT were used as a ternary blends system in producing mortar."
"For ternary blends system, CT was partially replaced at 15% of GFFA blend with GCCB at the dosage levels of 5%, at 15% GFFA blend with GCCB at the dosage levels of 15% and at 15% of GFFA blends with GCCB at the dosage levels of 25% by weight of cementitious materials."
The ratio of water to cementitious material (W/B) was used constant at 0.48 and the flow test of mortar was also kept between 105-115% with superplasticizer.
"Compressive strength, water absorption and chloride penetration were investigated."
Test results found that the use of 15% of GFFA produced mixes of mortar with good compressive strength.
Compressive strength of 15% of GFFA is high at 78-96% in comparison with the CT mortar mixes.
"However, the water absorption and chloride penetration of mortar with 15% of GFFA+5% of GCCB, 15% of GFFA+15% of GCCB and 15% of GFFA+25% of GCCB mortar is high in comparison with the mortar mixes at 15% of GFFA by weight of cementitious materials."
