"This paper is a study of fast pyrolysis of Leucaena leucocephala wood in a cylindrical vibrating reactor in order to investigate several parameters including biomass particle size, reaction heated zone length, biomass feed rate, nitrogen flow rate and vapour residence time."
Also investigated is the catalytic upgrading of the produced bio-oils applying titanium dioxide (TiO2) and Perlite.
"The results showed that optimum conditions were biomass particle size of 0.6-1.0 mm, heated zone length of 55 cm, biomass feed rate of 1 kg/h, nitrogen flow rate of 5 l/min, which gave a maximum bio-oil yield of 61.4% and the bio-oil had a heating value of 17.0 MJ/kg."
"In this paper a new discovery was made in addition to bio-oil and water, oily was obtained with a heating value of 26.6 MJ/kg."
The upgrading step led to the increase of bio-oil heating value and the reduction of water content.
"By applying TiO2 and perlite, the bio-oi yields were 6.04 and 6.76% with heating values of 29.5 and 28.9 MJ/kg and the water content was reduced from 46.3% (non-catalytic bio-oil) to 11.7 and 12.2%, respectively."
