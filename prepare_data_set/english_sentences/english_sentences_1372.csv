This paper presents the design and prototype of an automatic sliding roof system to facilitate the opening and closing of the roof with an IoT platform using the NodeMCU ESP8266.
The design of the photo sensor and the rain sensor is described for an automatic sliding roof system.
The operation of the system consists of 2 modes as mode 1: the system closes the roof during the day and opens the roof at night; mode 2: the system automatically opens and closes the roof according to the detection of the rain sensor.
The rotational speed of the motor depends on the rainwater value that the sensor detects.
"From the experimental results, it was found that the roof can open when the light sensor is activated and when the illuminance is less than 100 lux."
The roof will be closed when the illuminance is greater than 100 lux.
