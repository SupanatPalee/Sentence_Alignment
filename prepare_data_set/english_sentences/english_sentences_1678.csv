The research objectives were determined a dietary supplementation of vitamins C and E to enhance the growth rates and survival rates.
"The experiments were designed treatments 120 yellow mystus fish aged 5 months, an average weight of 130–150g and an average length of 18–25 cm and were divided into 4 groups, 10 fishes of a group, three times of each group."
"For the experimental group includes group one (code T1) nonvitamin supplement in food, group two (code T2) vitamin C at 1,000 mg/kg, group three (code T3) vitamin supplement at 500 mg/kg and group four (code T4) added at 1,000 mg/kg of vitamins C and E at 500 mg/kg, respectively."
"For after 4 weeks, the results showed that efficacy average daily weight gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and survival rate (SR), in three groups of T2, T3, and T4 groups showed a significant increase comparison with the control group of T1 (p<0.05)."
"Considering in the experiments of water quality for use indicators of dissolved oxygen (DO) is 4.10–4.90 g/l, temperature (T) at 28.30–32.0.0 °C, pH at 6.35–7.10, and an ammonia at 0–0.001 g/l."
"In fact, the dietary supplementations of vitamins C and E were associated with survival rates and growth performance, especially in those on sub-adult yellow mystus."
