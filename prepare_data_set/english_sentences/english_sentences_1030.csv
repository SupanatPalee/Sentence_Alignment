sentences
"The objective of this research was to study of drying kinetics, color quality and specific energy consumption of ginger at drying temperature of 50Â°C, constant vacuum pressure at absolute pressure of 10 kPa and pulsed vacuum with pulse ratio of 10:2 and 15:2 minute, the ratio of vacuum pressure time and atmosphere pressure time."
The result found that ginger was dried by pulsed vacuum drying could be achieved faster than constant vacuum drying.
"Moreover, increasing in pulse ration from 10:2 to 15:2 minute would affect to increased drying rate whereas drying time and specific energy consumption were decreased."
"The pulse ration at 15:2 minute had minimal specific energy consumption, SEC=28.84 MJ/kgwater-evap."
The color of ginger revealed the brightness value was similar in every experiments.
The red and yellow values of the ginger dried by constant vacuum pressure were the highest.
