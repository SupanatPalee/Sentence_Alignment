Patients can carry or wear the queue device in order that they can do other activities during waiting for the service queue.
"The developed system consisted of 3 parts: Part 1 is wearable queue devices designed in the form of a wristband and they had to be cheap, small and easily portable."

Part 2 was the queue calling push button.
"When it was pressed, the signal was sent to the third part, i.e., the queue management controller for processing and sending the queue information to the wearable queue devices."
"The experimental results showed that the developed queue management system can be implemented successfully as designed for both simulation and real situations at the medical service center, Mahasarakham University."
"Therefore, it can facilitate the patients to do other activities during queue waiting."
