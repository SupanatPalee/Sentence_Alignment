"The solar dryer with 4 drying chambers, in this research, was constructed to test the performance of passive solar dryer (PSD) and active solar dryer (ASD)."
"Air flowrate of ASD varied in this study are 0.03 m3/s (ASD0.03), 0.06 m3/s (ASD0.06) and 0.09 m3/s (ASD0.09)."
Pork with initial moisture content of 265 % dry basis was selected as testing material.
"The criteria used to evaluate the solar dryer performance are drying rate, solar dryer efficiency and specific energy consumption."
It was found from the experimental results that the ASDs performance are higher than that of PSD.
"Furthermore, it was revealed that the drying rate of ASD0.06 is higher than that for PSD, ASD0.03 and ASD0.09 by 19.35%, 10.52% and 8.86%, respectively."
"Whilst, specific energy consumption of ASD0.06 is lower than that for PSD, ASD0.03 and ASD0.09 by 26.56%, 17.13% and 15.65%, respectively."
"Finally, it was also found that solar dryer efficiency of PSD, ASD0.03, ASD0.06 and ASD0.09 are 11.68%, 12.68%, 14.91% and 12.91%, respectively."
