A method was developed and growth performance of experimental nursery Nile tilapia juveniles was supplementation diets with prebiotics mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) and a-tocopherol (vitamin E; VE) and intestinal morphological changes.
The research was planned the experiment completely randomize design (CRD).
"The average body weight (g) of Nile tilapia was 20.05±1.50 g and in total, 360 of the fish samples."
"Experimental fish about 20.05 g Nile tilapia were divided into four different treatments: the treatment 1–4 showed the minimum value for theses measurements for 28 days, treatment 1 (MOS 0% and VE 0%),  treatment 2 (MOS 1%), treatment 3 (VE 1%), and treatment 4 (MOS 1% + VE 1%), respectively."
"The treatment 2 showed that the final body weight (28.26±1.07g), DWG (8.11±0.56 g/day), final length (14.18±1.85 cm), SGR (7.63±3.42%/day), and FCR (2.30±0.02) of Nile tilapia, which specific groups were statistically significantly different from each other (p<0.05)."
"Treatment 4 SR showed the value highest at 97.37±1.22% and treatment 3 at 95.32±2.30% and treatment 2 at 95.07±1.94% and treatment 1 at 89.12±4.43%, respectively."
"The intestine villi length showed the higher values (1,512.22±202.48 µm & 1,500.00±227.58 µm) in the treatments (2 and 4) than the values (1,409.59±354.41 µm & 1,360.88±293.267 µm) in the treatments (3 and 1) respectively."
The current study recommends using the dietary with MOS 1% to improve juvenile Nile tilapia's performance and intestinal villi length.
