The Allele frequencies of 15 autosomal STR loci were established from 150 unrelated Myanmarese individuals using the Thailand Office of Police Forensic Science database.
"Allele frequency were calculated from Autosomal STR markers which verified by AmpFlSTR Identifiler plus PCR Amplification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Investigator IDplex GO kit (Qiagen, DEU)."
The results shown The allele frequencies were calculated under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P-value â‰¥0.05) except D2S1338 and vWA.
"The range of allele frequencies was 0.0033 to 0.5333 Heterozygosity ranged from 0.6267 to 0.8600, probability of identity from 0.0304 to 0.2081, and probability of paternity exclusion from 0.3753 to 0.7494."
"The allele frequency and Genotype appearance of Myanmar populations in Thailand was compared with other countries, including Myanmar population in China, AfricanAmerican, Caucasian, Hispanic and Asian."
The results demonstrated that the difference of Allele frequency of each population.
This study is a powerful tool for used as a reference in forensic genetic testing
