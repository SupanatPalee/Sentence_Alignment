"The processes of coating bronze or tin-copper alloys by electrodeposition have been employed for a long time in various applications such as jewelry, antiques, and bearings."
"These processes were used for improving properties such as topography, corrosion resistance of the coating surface."
"The desirable properties of the materials depend on various factors used in the coating process including temperature, coating duration, concentration of the electrolyte solution, applied current, and voltage."
"Therefore, the purpose of this article is for studying the effect on electrodeposition of tin-copper alloys to the following properties: improvement of surface finish by adding additives, studying corrosion prevention by varying quantities of tin including increasing the temperature in the coating process, and improvement of the microstructure with pulse current."
