"The purpose of this paper was to compare the efficiency of the population mean estimator of the 4 Ranked Set Samplings which were Ranked Set Sampling (RSS), Extreme Ranked Set Sampling (ERSS), Balanced Group Ranked Set Sampling (BGRSS) and Two-Stage Ranked Set Sampling (TSRSS) compared with the population mean estimator from Simple Random Sampling (SRS) when respectively sequencing from the auxiliary variables and the primary variable 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 and Error in Ranking from sequenced groups study."
Bivariate data simulation was Bivariate Normal Distribution and Bivariate Lognormal Distribution.
The efficiency of the population mean estimators from there samplings technique was considered from Relative efficiency.
The result revealed that the efficiency of the population for mean estimator depended on the correlation between auxiliary variable and primary variable and distributions.
