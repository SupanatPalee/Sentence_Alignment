"In server cabinet manufacture industry, the lateness in the measurement process affects the productivity of the manufacturing process."
"Therefore, this research aimed to improve an efficiency of the spot weld measurement process in server cabinet part."
The ECRS technique was applied for a convenient usage and a measured time decrease.
The fixture was designed and studied the standard time for measurement and standard time discovery.
"Afterwards, the received results were compared with the conventional measurement."
"The study found that the designed fixture was used in part 3 and 9 revealed 5.16 and 5.53 of the standard time, respectively."
This result indicated the decrease in the standard measurement time with good continent of QA officer.
"For part 1, 4 and 8, the standard time is 7.76, 9.20 and 9.51 minute, respectively."
All results displayed the more convenient and less standard measurement time than the old one.
"The efficiency of time decrease is 29.02%, 16.84%, 39.42%, 39.94% and 35.39% for part 3, 9, 1, 4 and 8."
"Moreover, the proficiency of QA officer was not required for high-efficiency work."
