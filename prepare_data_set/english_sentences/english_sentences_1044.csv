This research is the development of a mathematical model to predict an appropriate working fluid for small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power generation.
"In this study, 15 working fluids were compared."
"The indicators considered in this study consisted of thermal efficiency, the maximum pressure in the cycle, steam quality, mass flow rate, heat input to the system, toxicity, flammability, and Global Warming Potential (GWP)."
The results showed that the mathematical modeling of the ORC power generation developed in this study can be applied to estimate the power output of the system.
This was because the variable value of mathematical modeling was not significantly different in comparison to the published data.
"As considered in terms of low-GWP, low-toxicity, and non-flammable; R245ca, R365mfc, R245fa, and R1234zez were suitable because they gave a low mass flow rate, low evaporating pressure, and high thermal efficiency."
