Application of fertilizers according to the soil analysis data was a technology that is a widely used because it helps to reduce the cost of crop production.
"The objectives of this study were to study physicochemical properties of soil and recommendations for chemical fertilizers application in the soil analysis data in Sikhoraphum District, Surin Province."
"Soil samples were stratified randomly sampling from 53 fields in order to analyze soil nutrients by using the KU soil test kit, soil pH using a pH meter, soil texture by Hydrometer method, soil color using a Mansell color chart and organic matter (OM) by Walkley and Black method."
"The fertilizer formula on paddy and sugarcane soils were calculated from the individual fertilizer program of Land Development Department and the guide of the chemical fertilizers application according to the soil analysis data of Community Eco Power Foundation, respectively."
The results showed that all soil samples were found as sandy loam and reddish brown.
The pH value ranged from 5.5-7.1.
OM was between 0.12 to 3.26%.
Soil nutrients were in the range of very low to very high.
"The recommendation for fertilizer formula according to the soil analysis on paddy soils showed that the first time, 46-0-0, 0-46-0 and 0-0-60 at 4.35-8.70, 2.17-5.87 and 6.67 kg/rai."
"The second time, only 46-0-0Â  should be applied at the same of the first time."
"The recommendation for fertilizer formula according to the soil analysis on sugarcane soils showed that the first time, 46-0-0, 18-46-0 and 0-0-60 at 12-15, 13-20 and 30 kg/rai."
"The second time, only 46-0-0 should be applied at 20 kg/rai."
These values revealed that soil fertility levels were relatively low.
The farmers did not use fertilizers according to the appropriate formula and rates.
"Therefore, the farmers should apply fertilizer according to the soil analysis data to enhance soil nutrition for plant production and maintain the efficiency of soil use for sustainability."
