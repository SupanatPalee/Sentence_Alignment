"ABSTRACT This paper presents the design and economic analysis of solar rooftop electricity system for the Post Engineer Department, Royal Thai Army (RTA)."
The program computer is used for estimate the electricity energy obtained from the installed solar panel using actual building location and historical weather.
The project is aimed to be the pilot project for designing and development of solar electricity installation in other building of RTA and in order to fulfill the RTAâ€™s energy conservation policy with target of 10% electricity reduction.
The payback period and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are also investigated in this study.
The simulation results shown that the solar panel installed on the South-East side roof top of the building provide approximately 5% higher electricity generation than those of installed on the North-West side.
"The total electricity generation is 34,809 kWh/month which is equivalent to 1,670,832 Baht/year."
"As a result, the project payback period is approximately 7 years and provides 18% of electricity reduction."
"Moreover, the GHG emission is reduced by 225.56 ton of CO2 e/year."
"KEYWORDS: Solar roof top electricity, economic analysis, greenhouse gas emission"
