"In this research was studied parameters of 42P2O5: (14–x)Na2O: 39ZnO: 5BaO: xCu2O (x = 2, 4, 6,8 and 10 mol%) glass system for radiation shielding."
"These parameters were mass attenuation coefficient, effective atomic number, half value layer and mean free path."
These parameters have been estimated by using WinXCom at energy ranging from 10–3–105 MeV.
The results were presented that mass attenuation coefficient was decreased with increased energy.
"These events of radiation parameter were separated three processes including photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering and pair production at low, medium and high energy ranging, respectively."
"Besides that, 42P2O5: 4Na2O: 39ZnO: 5BaO: 10Cu2O glass sample had mass attenuation coefficient and effective atomic number highest while half value layer and mean free path had lowest value."
These results indicated that this sample had excellent potential and could be applied as radiation shielding material.
