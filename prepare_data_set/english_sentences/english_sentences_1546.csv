The determination of favipiravir for antiviral COVID-19 using a bare glassy carbon electrode was successfully operated by the electrooxidation reaction of the favipiravir.
The reaction process was recorded by cyclic voltammetry while the amperometric technique was used for favipiravir quantitation.
"Analytical parameters such as applied potential, supporting electrolytes, and pH were varied."
"The optimum condition was found to be +1.30 V, Na2B4O7 – NaOH buffer, and pH 10.20, respectively."
The electrochemical sensor was characteristic studied and it showed a linear range of 0.25 µM to 500.0 µM (y (µA)=0.0326x(µM) + 0.1547) with a limit of detection of 0.13 µM favipiravir (S/N=3).
This technique exhibited high repeatability at 4.64 %RSD and the interference such as NaCl was unaffected.
It was successful in analyzing favipiravir in real samples with high accuracy as the relative error was lower than 1.96 percent.
"From the results of the research, this sensor can be used to measure the amount of favipiravir in tablet samples to benefit consumers"
