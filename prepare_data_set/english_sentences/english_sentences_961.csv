This research has the purpose of applying the technology of electricity generated from solar energy to cooperate with the O2 bubble technology of the water oxygen circulating aeration system as a guideline for reducing energy costs in sorting green caviar seaweed and comparing energy costs between non-alternative and hybrid solar inverter systems.
Data was collected from August 2022 to January 2023.
"The electrical load used in sorting green caviar seaweed consisted of two parts: 1) a load of 1.5 kW, and 2) a load of 1.1 kW."
"Each part of the load was continuously used for 24 hours, and it took turns working every other day."
"The results of testing the electrical energy quantity produced by the hybrid solar inverter system showed the production quantities of the energy used as follows: it produced electrical energy equal to 278 kWh in August, accounting for 24.82%, and 283 kWh in September, accounting for 25.27%."
"276 kWh, accounting for 24.64% in October; 274 kWh, accounting for 32.62% in September; 305 kWh, accounting for 36.31% in December; and in January 293 kWh, accounting for 34.88%."
"When comparing the cost of the aeration system's electrical energy in sorting Green Caviar seaweed after installing the hybrid solar inverter system with a load size of 1.5 kW, average cost savings in energy expenses equaled 25.74%, while with a load size of 1.1 kW, it was 36.11%."
