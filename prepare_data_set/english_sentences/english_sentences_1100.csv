The objective of this research was to study the influence of drying air velocity by pulse flow in vertical chamber with pneumatic dryer on paddy drying.
The pneumatic dryer prototype was used in this study.
has the vertical tube with a diameter of 3.81 cm and height 100 cm as a drying chamber.
The drying of 15 kg of Hom Pathum paddy at 22–25% initial wet basis moisture content is tested under the drying air temperature 80ºC until its moisture is 14% wet basis.
"The test are performed with two different drying air conditions: 1) constant velocity and 2) pulse flow velocity of drying air for study the drying behavior, drying rate (DR), specific energy consumption (SEC), and thermal efficiency of drying."
"The results showed that drying with pulse flow velocity conditions gives a shorter time, higher drying rate, lower total SEC consumption, and higher thermal efficiency than drying with constant velocity conditions."
