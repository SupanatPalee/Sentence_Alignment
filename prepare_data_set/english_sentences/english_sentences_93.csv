The research aims to study the surface roughness prediction in turning of ductile cast iron using response surface methodology with experiment design of Box-Behnken design.
"Factors used in the experiment include speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and corner radius using ductile cast iron FCD 400."
"From the experiment, factors affecting the surface roughness are speed, corner radius, feed rate, and depth of cut."
The surface roughness tended to decrease when the feed rate and depth of cut were decreased and increasing the speed corner radius up.
"The optimal conditions on the surface roughness were the speed of 1,700 rpm, feed rate of 0.04 mm/rev, depth of cut 0.1 mm, and corner radius of 1.2 mm."
These conditions resulted in the surface roughness of 0.2589 Âµm.
"From boring turning to study the wear characteristics of the insert, it was found that the fracture wears at the cutting edge due to the fraction and impact on the workpiece"
