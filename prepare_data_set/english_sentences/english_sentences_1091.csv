"This research presents a water quality control system in shrimp pond using Internet of Things  to automatically control the feeding of nutrients, minerals, adjust PH and temperature sensors by using TDS, PH and temperature sensors to transmit data over the internet to show the status on an LCD screen and controlled by a keyboard placed in front of the shrimp pond."
The web application uses an ESP32 microcontroller to operate a shrimp pond controller and works with a Raspberry pi connected to the Thingsboard Platform.
"The accuracy test of the measured values ​​from the temperature sensor, TDS sensor, and PH sensor compared with the standard instrumentation devices ten times throughout the period of one day found that the percentage of the error caused by the temperature sensor was 0.4 percent, the TDS sensor had an error of 1.4 percent, and the PH sensor had an error of 1.32 percent."
