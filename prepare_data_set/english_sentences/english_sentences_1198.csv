This paper aims to analyze a vibration respond of a downstream structure when subjectedto an air flow.
"In order to seek an optimal downstream structure for energy harvesting application,different configurations of downstream structure were tested in a low turbulence intensity windtunnel in a range of 3000-20000 of Reynolds number."
Particular attention was paid to study avibration response to subjected flow.
A tested model consists of upstream cylinder connectedwith a downstream tip body via aluminum cantilever beam.
"According to experimental results, thevibration response of downstream structure depended on both of shapes of downstream structureand aluminum cantilever beam length."
The highest vibration amplitude was found in a testedmodel with a triangular tip body and aluminum cantilever beam length of 160 mm.
"Furthermore,from smoke-flow visualization study, the high vibration response can be found when vorticeswere formed on each side of downstream structure."
"On the contrary, if the vortices were formedbehind the downstream structure, there will be little or no vibration response for downstreamstructure."
