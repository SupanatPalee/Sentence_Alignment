sentences
This research studied the synthesis of kaolin and fly ash based geopolymer.
Geopolymer was used to adsorb brilliant green (BG) dye from aqueous solution.
"The suitable dosage of kaolin and fly ash based geopolymer were 0.25 and 0.25 g/L, the contact time were 360 and 180 minutes with the adsorption efficiency 96.62 and 96.61% for initial BG concentration of 100 ppm, respectively."
Kinetic study showed that the adsorption of both geopolymers were followed the pseudo-second order model.
Kaolin based geopolymer cannot be regenerated.
Fly ash based geopolymer can be regenerated 3 times.
This suggested that geopolymer from fly ash showed the potential to be used as an adsorbent for brilliant green dye removal.
