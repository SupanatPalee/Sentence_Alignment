"This research aims to study effects of natural fiber contents and types on mechanical, physical and thermal properties of binderless fiberboard."
The materials were manufactured into sample fiberboards that have an average density 0.9 gram per cubic centimeter by using a hot compression machine.
"From the experiment, the addition of natural fibers into binderless fiberboard can improve some mechanical and physical properties."
"The fiberboard mixed with oil palm fruit bunche (OPB) fiber or coir fiber 10 percent by weight (wt%) gave higher internal bond strength (IBS) than that ofthe fiberboard based, and the fiberboard mixed with OPB fiber in range of 10-30 wt% showed lower water absorption than the fiberboard based."
"However, the addition of natural fibers increased thermal conductivity of the binderless fiberboard."
"Further, the increasing addition of OPB fiber or coir fiber in range of 10-30 wt% increased modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) but decreased maximum flexural strain, water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (TS)."
"Furthermore, when compared at the same ratio of composition, the fiberboard mixed with OPB fiber gave the highest IBS, MOR and MOE, and the fiberboard with coir fiber showed the largest WA and TS."
