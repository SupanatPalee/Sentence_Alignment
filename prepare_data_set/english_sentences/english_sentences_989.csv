Black galingale has medicinal properties and it is also an economic medicinal plant that can be developed into a variety of products.
"Therefore, this research aimed at studying the drying kinetics of black galingale by using 3 techniques as follows: hot air drying (HA), infrared drying (IR) and hot air combined with infrared drying (HA&IR)."
The experiment was conducted under the followings condition: drying air temperature of 45‡πêC and air velocity of 2.0 m/s.
The black galingale was dried from the initial moisture content of 136.0 %d.b.
to the final moisture content of 8.0 %d.b.
"The parameters used as criteria for investigating the drying performance are color quality, water activity, specific energy consumption, and mathematical models to predict drying kinetics."
The experimental results showed that the moisture of black galingale decreased rapidly when it was activated with infrared energy.
"It was also found that IR, HA&IR and HA yielded the drying time of 515, 557 and 935 minutes, respectively."
"In terms of color quality, the color change of IR was lower than that for HA&IR and HA by 2.67 % and 21.46 %, respectively."
"Furthermore, it was found that the specific energy consumption of HA&IR was the lowest."
"For water activity, all drying techniques were in accordance with the standards of food drying."
"Finally, results revealed that the best mathematical model for predicting the drying kinetic of black galingale using HA, IR and HA&IR were Weibull distribution, Two-term and Weibull distribution, respectively."
