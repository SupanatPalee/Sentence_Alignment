The objective of development of Water meal (Wolffia arrhiza (L.) Wimm.)
"noodle product was studied the optimum content of powder Water meal (PWM) for mixing into noodles, investigated a quality of physical, chemical and tested a shelf life."
"In this research, PWM was produced by a hot air drying from the fresh Water meal at 50 °C for 5 h, grinded and sifted by a sieve size of 80 mesh."
"After that, PWM of 0, 0.25, 5, 7.5 and 10 % by flour weight were mixed for producing of noodles."
"It was found that the lightness, greenness and yellowness (L*, a*, b*) values decreased with increasing the amount of PWM in noodle which observed the increasing of green color in noodle."
"It noted noodle that a hardness increased, a chewiness, a tensile strength and an elasticity decreased with increasing of PWM."
"However, the amount of PWM of 2.5% in noodles was shown a physical quality similar to that of an original noodle (0%) but shown better a chemical quality."
"It was observed that a chemical quality of noodle mixed PWM of 2.5 % was contained a protein of 15.51 %, a fiber of 4.22 %, a phenolic of 0.07 g.gallic/100 g DW."
and a chlorophyll of 5.42 mg/kg DW.
"Nevertheless, the noodles mixed PWM of 0% and 2.5 % were abled a storage at 6±2°C for 6 days."
"Therefore, in this research found that the mixing of PWM at 2.5 % was resulted the same in physical quality and shelf life as original noodles whereas resulted in a higher nutritional value."
