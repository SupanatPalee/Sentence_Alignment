This research presents the effects of the mixed fuels on the combustion characteristics of the updraft gasifier.
"The mixed fuels of biomass between the charcoals (#1, #2, #3 and #4) and the rice husk were studied."
"The charcoal and the rice husk were mixed at the ratio of 100:0, 70:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 by net weight of the mixed fuels at 0.5 kilograms per batch."
"Then the flow rate of air was varied of 30, 45, 60 and 75 LPM."
The heat value obtained from the combustion of the product gas and the temperature in the combustion zone of the furnace and the pressure drop of air flowing through the fuel layer were investigated.
The experimental results show that the charcoal at different sizes cause different efficiency values.
"The charcoal #2 illustrates the highest combustion efficiency, which is 47.9%."
The mixed fuel biomass between charcoal and rice husk can significantly increase the efficiency of the updraft gasifier.
The mixture of the charcoal #2 and the rice husk at the ratio of 75:25 by weight can improve the combustion efficiency of 49.5%.
