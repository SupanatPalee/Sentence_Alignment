This study aims to investigate effects of Lactobacillus spp.
on growth performance in broiler chicken and on bacterial spoilage contamination in their meat under refrigeration storage (4-6°C).
Ninety chicks (1 day old) were randomly assigned into 3 groups with 30 chicks per group.
"Three diets were provided following: group 1 basal diet (recommended by NRC), group 2 basal diet supplemented with Lactobacillus salivarius L61 (1´107 CFU/ g of feed) and group 3 basal diet supplemented with commercial probiotic strain (Lactobacillus plantarum Fr-B) (1´ 107 CFU/ g of feed)."
Lactobacillus supplementation was started at 25 day old and finished at 35 day old of broilers.
Each group of 10 chicks was randomly slaughtered and sampled intestinal contents for coliform plate count.
"Breast meat samples were collected under refrigeration storage (4-6 °C) for 1 and 3 days, and analyzed for coliform bacteria and Pseudomonas spp."
counts.
This result showed that L. salivarius L61 supplementation improved growth performance (p< 0.05) compared to control group.
Coliform and Pseudomonas spp.
counts in refrigerated meat at 1 day from chickens raised basal diet with either L. salivarius L61 or L. plantarum Fr-B supplementation were significantly lower (p< 0.05) compared to control group.
"Moreover, L. salivarius L61 supplementation showed the highest reduction of Pseudomonas spp."
counts in meat under refrigeration storage for 1 or 3 days compared to control group (p< 0.05).
L. salivarius L61 supplementation can reduce contaminant coliform and Pseudomonas spp.
"counts in meat under refrigeration storage for 1 day at 84.16% and 98.42%, respectively."
This study indicated that supplementation of L. salivarius L61 in broiler diets may improve shelf life of broiler chicken meat under refrigeration storage.
