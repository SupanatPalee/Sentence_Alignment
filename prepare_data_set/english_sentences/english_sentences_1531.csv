The aim of research was to study the factors affected quality of reduced sodium steamed mackerel.
"This study varied the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) (20, 15, 10, 5 and 0%) combined with concentration of potassium chloride (KCl) (20, 15, 10, 5 and 0%), cooking time (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 min)."
"The proper reduced sodium steamed mackerel were tested by using different types of packaging (polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride; PVC and PS), Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Nylon Linear Low Density Polyethylene (NLLDPE))."
All samples were kept refrigerated at 4±2°C for 7 days.
The experimental design used was response surface methodology (RSM).
"Results showed that the proper reduced sodium steamed mackerel used 10% NaCl combined with 10% KCl and steamed for 3 min had the sodium and potassium values of 5,817 และ 5,997 mg/kg and received highest overall sensory score (8.40)."
The values of sensory score was no significant difference from the control (30% NaCl) (8.25) (p>0.05).
The shelf life of reduced sodium steamed mackerel packed in PS and PVC was only 3 days having total microbial count higher than the standard.
"While, the reduced sodium steamed mackerel packed in LLDPE and NLLDPE had the shelf life of 6 days at 4±2°C."
The microbiological results of total plate count was not exceed the standard.
"No E.coli, Salmonella spp."
yeast and mold were detected.
