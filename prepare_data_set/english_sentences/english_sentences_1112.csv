The Central Composite based Response Surface Methodology (RSM) (Design-Expert 10.0.1) was used to optimize acid catalyzed pretreatment of corn stover.
"The experimental of pretreatment was conducted under the acid concentration of 0.05 - 0.15 M using sulfuric acid, formic acid and phosphoric acid as homogeneous promoters."
The reaction time of 15 - 45 min were selected.
The reaction temperature of 90 - 210°C was selected all the works.
"After pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis was also hydrolyzed the pretreated solid to evaluate the optimal pretreatment conditions for maximizing sugar production."
The results showed that pretreatment with 0.1M sulfuric acid at 180°C for 30 min was found to be the optimal condition for pretreatment of corn stover.
The optimal condition was focused on the highest sugar production from enzymatic hydrolysis with low inhibitory by-product detected in the aqueous phase after pretreatment.
The optimum condition showed 88.93% reducing sugar and 89.26 glucose yield from enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated corn stover.
Hemicellulose solubilization of 85.08% was removed under the optimal condition.
Scanning electron microscopy revealed disruption of the intact biomass structure allowing increasing enzyme’s accessibility to the cellulose microfibers which showed higher crystallinity index compared to the native biomass as shown by x-ray diffraction with a marked increase in surface area as revealed by BET measurement.
The work provides an insight into effects of acid pretreatment on modification of physicochemical properties of corn stover and an efficient approach for its processing in biorefinery industry.
