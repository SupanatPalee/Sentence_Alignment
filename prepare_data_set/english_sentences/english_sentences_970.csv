sentences
"This paper presents the study of vibrations under rotating unbalance, comparing the results between the experiment and the mathematical model."
The optimal vibration absorber can be solved using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method.
The test unit is a beam with a pinned support.
"The unbalanced motor, a spring and a damper are attached to another end beam."
"The vibration measurement is performed with the ADXL345 accelerometer, which is connected to the MEGA 2560 R3 board."
The data is processed and sent to the computer to record the results in the time domain and frequency domain.
The results show that the mathematical model has a similar acceleration behavior to the experimental results at a damping ratio of 0.1 and a motor speed of 220 rpm.
The particle swarm optimization method is effective for determining the vibration absorber.
"If the system consists of a vibration absorber, the results show that the amplitude of vibration acceleration decreases significantly with an unbalanced motor."
