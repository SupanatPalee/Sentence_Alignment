"Steel-concrete composite, which is known as composite structure has been popularly constructed for bridge construction."
It is made from steel connected with slab concrete holding together again with shear connectors.
This facilitates in loading capacity according to AISC and AASHTO standard designs.
"The results of the research bring out the fact that the fully composite has more loading capacity than the partially composite, that is 5.528 percent."
The study also focuses on the deformation capacity ratio between the fully composite and the partial composite under the above mentioned condition.
"In this aspect , it is found that the deformation capacity of the fully composite is less than the partial composite, that is 12.636 percent."
"Drawing from the study, it is suggested that at the practical level, the steel concrete composite have to be design as the fully composite because with this design, it is able to hold the highest strength, prevent slipping between steel and slab concrete , and increase the durability."
