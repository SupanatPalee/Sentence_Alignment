This research studied the effect of modified surface of calcium oxide (CaO) adsorbent on the CO2 adsorption by using local eggshell waste as an adsorbent raw material.
Egg shell is a  main source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which can be converted to CaO via calcination reaction.
"The studying factors in the surface modifying step which  affecting the BET specific surface area were atomic ratio of Titanium to Nickel, Nickel reducing time and calcination temperature."
The results showed that the adsorbent with the different atomic ratio of Titanium to Nickel gave more BET specific surface area than using the same atomic ratio.
The increasing of calcination temperature increased the BET specific surface area.
"However, the increasing of Nickel reducing time decreased the BET specific surface area."
"Moreover, the surface modified adsorbent which atomic ratio of Titanium to Nickel 1:1, Nickel reducing time in 60 min and calcination temperature at 900oC gave the highest BET specific surface area of 7.37 m2/ g sorbent."
"When choosing the maximum BET surface area of modified adsorbent for CO2 adsorption test in fluidized bed reactor, the results revealed that the modified surface calcium oxide adsorbent was capable to adsorb CO2 with 22.12 mg CO2/ g sorbent."
The adsorption capacity was higher than that of the CaO adsorbent without modification which was 10.5 mg CO2/g sorbent at the same adsorption condition.
