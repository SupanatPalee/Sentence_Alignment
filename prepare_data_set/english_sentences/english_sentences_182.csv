Knife edge is a crucial part for cutting rice mixed with konjac flour to form perfect rice kernel shape with minimum losses and maximum yield.
The objective of this study was to design the appropriate cutting blade geometry to form rice mixed with konjac flour.
"Three characteristics of the knife edge were studied: (1) a front curve of the knife edge, (2) a backward curve of the knife edge, and (3) a straight shape of the knife edge."
"The angle of the blade were studied at 30, 45, and 60 degrees."
"Different blade speeds were studied at 135, 145, 155 and 165 rpm."
"The results showed the backward curvature of the blade edge with an angle of 30 degrees can cut the flour piece to obtain the perfect shape as rice at a rate of 1,525 seed/min."
"On the other hands, a motor speed of 145 rpm gave the perfect shape as rice at the rate of 1,790 seed/min."
