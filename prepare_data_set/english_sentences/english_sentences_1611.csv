"This research aimed to assess the carbon storage contents of sugar palms in the palm plantation and the natural areas and to compare the difference of carbon storage contents in both sources of Ban Lat district, Phetchaburi province."
The height of 403 sugar palm trees in the palm plantation and 500 sugar palm trees in the natural areas were collected for analysis of the above-ground biomass values by the Allometric equation.
The results revealed that the mean of carbon content sequestered in the palm plantation was 30.84±2.59 kilogram Carbon.
While the average of carbon storage content in the natural areas was 37.08±2.28 kilogram Carbon.
"When the means of carbon storage content in both sources were compared, the result showed that the mean of carbon content sequestered in the palm of both sources was significantly different at p< 0.05."
