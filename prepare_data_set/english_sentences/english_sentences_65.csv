This paper presents effects of the angle between steel fiber orientation and failure plane (qf) on compressive strength and flexural strength of self-compacting mortar.
"Mortar proportions contained water to cement ratio of 35% and 45% with sand to mortar ratio of 40%, 45% and 50%."
"Fiber quantity of 0.8% and 1.6% by volume of mortar are compared and the influence of the angle between steel fiber orientation and failure plane (qf) of 0°, 30°, 45°, and 90° is studied."
"Research results showed that the compressive strength increased approximately 20% by increasing fiber amount of 0.8%, but it was found that the compressive strength reduced with the increase of steel fiber to 1.6%."
The angle between steel fiber orientation and failure plane (qf) at 30° and 45°.
affected in an increase in flexural strength by an average of 50%-70% when compared to the qf of 0°.
"However, it was found that the compressive strength decreased from the highest value by approximately 20%-30% with the qf of 90°."
"The most efficient reinforcing steel fiber in self-compacting mortar requires a consideration of fiber content, fiber orientation, and failure plane."
