This research aimed to design and make double-sided friction stir welding equipment and to study friction stir welding using the double-sided friction stir welding equipment.
"The double-sided friction welding equipment consisted of 5 major parts, i.e."
"drive shaft, gear train, engine compartment, rotary shaft, and friction stir welding head."
"AA7075-T651 aluminum alloy was used with 50 x 300 x 6 mm (width x length x thickness) under 3 levels of stir rotation speed, i.e."
"710, 1,000, and 1,400 rpm and 3 levels of welding speed, i.e."
"14, 20, and 40 mm/min."
The findings from the experiment showed that there were wider holes in welds at the retreating side due to the friction between the stir welding head and materials that did not absorb enough heat during the welding process.
Friction stir welding at the rotation speed of 710 rpm and welding speed of 14 mm/min produced the highest tensile strength of 360.58 MPa.
The highest hardness was produced at the rotation speed of 710 rpm and welding speed of 40 mm/min.
"The highest bending strength at the face bend, 40.26 N, was produced at rotation speed of 710 rpm and welding speed of 14 mm/min."
"The highest bending strength at the root bend, 26.10 N, was produced at the rotation speed of 710 rpm and welding speed of 14 mm/min."
