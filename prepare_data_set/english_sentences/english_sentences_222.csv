"At present, research studies on the increasing demand ampliÔ¨Åcation, or the bullwhip effect (BW), under a dual-sourcing supply chain network are limited."
"In addition, no existing research clearly states whether and how order lead times influence the bullwhip effect under the dual-sourcing supply chain environment."
This research thus investigates the impact of lead times on bullwhip effect in dual-supplier supply chain.
The retailer's orders are divided between two suppliers.
Both cases of equal and unequal lead times at the suppliers-retailer links are examined.
"In this research, a simulation approach is used to create the incoming demand process for the retailer according to first order autoregressive (AR(1)) model."
"Also, all members use the order-up-to inventory policy and the moving average forecasting technique."
The findings indicate that an increase in lead times is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in the bullwhip effect.
