sentences
This research is focused on the isolation of Arthronema africanum Sansab.
Samples were collected from the Sansab cannel of Bangkok Thailand to study of hydrogen production.
A. africanum Sansab requires various factors enhancing hydrogen production.
A. africanum Sansab cells adapted to conditions produced hydrogen consistent with improved BG110 that contains of 46 micromolar of iron 0.8 gram of sodium carbonate pH 7.0 and cultured under continuous light for a week and harvested.
"Then cultivation cells by agitated at 120 rpm at room temperature and under a light condition with 2,500 Lux for 24 hours."
The result showed that accumulation level of hydrogen production was increased to 55.42 µmolH2/mgChl/h after the 24 hours incubation cells under a light condition with improved BG110 compared with normal BG110 that accumulation the level of hydrogen production was 42.09 µmolH2/mgChl/h and A. africanum Sansab  cannot produced hydrogen when cultivation cells with BG11.
