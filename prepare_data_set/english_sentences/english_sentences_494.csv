This research focused on the variables affecting the working fluid circulating system with thermal energy of the horizontal by using steam for working fluid.
Temperature for boiling system is 115 ÂºC which is low heat energy can be applied to general waste from industrial or other sources.
"By the way, the researcher has experimented by increased volume of pressure tank from 19 L to 98 L that mean air mass increased 5.76 time."
The results of the experiment showed that volume of air inside pressure tank that increased has affected with pressure inside pressure tank because temperature of steam inside pressure tank will be increase too maximum temperature is 87.2 oC it will be directly proportional to the pressure inside pressure tank maximum pressure is 60.593 kPa and temperature difference inside the storage tank will a bit increased as time and circle of working fluid affected to quantity of heat accumulated in system.
"So, if volume of pressure tank decreased quantity of heat accumulated and thermal efficiency will be decrease as well."
