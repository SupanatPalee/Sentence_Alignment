This research proposed a scheduling method for an automotive part manufacturing process with job shop production environment.
A mixed integer linear programming based heuristic (MILP_H) was designed for dividing a group of job orders to several subgroups in case that number of jobs to be scheduled is large.
Then the proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models are used for generating a schedule for each subgroup.
"If all jobs in the subgroup have completed before their due date ,the MILP with minimizing makespan will be chosen for scheduling."
"Otherwise, the MILP with minimizing total weighted makespan and maximum lateness will be used to lessen the extra time for producing the tardy jobs to finish their production within due date."
The subgroup schedules then are combined as a production schedule for practice.
The 15-problem set consists of real and simulation scheduling problems was used for perfomance test.
The results revealed that the MILP_H can create production schedules with 4.22% reduction in average makespan and 22.62% decrease in the average of the maximum lateness.
