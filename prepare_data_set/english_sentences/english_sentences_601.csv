This research study aimed to investigate the effects of temperature change and storage pattern on the shelf life of sunflower sprouts refrigerated after harvesting.
"This study, which is based on experimental research, finds the appropriate shelf life and the layout of sunflower sprouts in refrigerator by compiling 9 sub-trials."
"The elapsed times of rottenness were recorded for sunflower sprouts stored in the refrigerator at 3 different temperatures: 2, 5 and 7 degrees Celsius, and 3 different layouts: adjoining layout, spacing layout, and spacing layout near the rear of the refrigerator interior."
Each experiment was repeated 5 times.
The statistical method used to analyze the data was two-way analysis of variance at a statistically significant level of .05.
It was found that the average temperature and the storage pattern had an effect on the shelf life of sunflower sprouts with a statistically significant level of .05.
The optimum storage temperature was 5 degrees Celsius and the optimum storage pattern was the adjoining storage pattern.
The optimum temperature and storage pattern resulted in the longest shelf life of sunflower sprouts for an average of 6.8 days.
