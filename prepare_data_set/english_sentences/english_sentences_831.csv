The purposes of the study were to investigate and analyze factors affecting to Napier mowing by using the design of experiments.
The factors were the movement speed (kilometer/hour) and the speed of cutting head (round/minute) which affected the length of the grass.
The experiment examined with 45 days and 60 days Napier through designing with full factorial design.
"After that, the grasses were cut by adjusting order."
The data of the experiment were analyzed through the statistical analysis programs.
The results had shown that the movement speed and the speed of cutting head of Napier mowing affected the length of the grass significantly at 0.05.
"Moreover, when cutting 45 days and 60 days old grass by the 50 horsepower tractor which the movement speed 5 kilometers/hour, and the speed of cutting head was 1,800 round/minute in an hour, the machine could cut the grass averagely at 6.84 tons with 3-5 centimeters long of grass."
