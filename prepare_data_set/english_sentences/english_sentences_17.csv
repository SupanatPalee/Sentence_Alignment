This research aimed to design the layout of the fabrication laboratory.
"The study applied the principles of Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and Process Layout (PL), which focus on the relationship between work stations, flow processes, and groups of machines."
The layouts were designed and simulated using the computer program.
Criteria were used for minimizing the total moving distance and the total moving time to consider the suitable design.
"The results showed that the SLP gave a total moving distance of 565.84 meters per person and a total moving time of 609.64 minutes per person, while the PL provided a total moving distance of 609.31 meters per person and a total moving time of 646.25 minutes per person."
"In conclusion, the plant layout obtained from the SLP was better than the PL in terms of shorter total moving distance (7.13%) and less total moving time (5.66%)."
