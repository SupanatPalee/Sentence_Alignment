"The 22.5 m3 economical cold storage unit is designed with a split air conditioning system, utilizing R-22 refrigerant to regulate the temperature in cold storage at 15 0C, thereby aiding in the preservation of fruits and vegetables before they are packaged."
"Within this operational configuration, both water and bananas are employed as heat loads."
"To comprehensively evaluate the system's efficiency,            a variety of parameters including refrigerant temperature and pressure, compressor power, storage temperature, and timing were examined to determine the COP."
"Experimental findings revealed that when water is used as the heat load, the refrigerant pressure fluctuates between 45 and 55 psig on the lower end and between 220 and 250 psig on the higher end."
"Notably, the temperature of the water can be reduced from 32 0C to 28 0C within 180 min."
"The COP values of the refrigeration system, operating within a temperature range of 14 to 25 0C within the cold storage, were found to range from 4.2 to 6.7."
"Conversely, when bananas are used as the heat load, their temperature decreases from 28 0C to 15 0C within 130 min."
"Under these conditions, the COP values of the refrigeration system, with storage temperatures ranging from 15 to 24 0C, were determined to vary between 4.1 and 6.2."
