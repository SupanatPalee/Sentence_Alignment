The objective of this research is to propose a mixed EWMA-OSMTC for detecting process mean when the process is symmetric distributions.
"The performance of  EWMA-OSMTC is compared with Tukey’s control chart (TCC), Optimal Synthetic Tukey’s control chart (OSTC) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average – Modified Tukey’s control chart (EWMA-MTCC), usually measured by the Average Run Length ()."
The in control average run length () is given to 370.
"In order to approximate ARL, the Monte Carlo simulation method is used and the numerical results found that EWMA-OSMTC is superior to TCC, OSTC and EWMA-MTCC for all magnitudes of change."
