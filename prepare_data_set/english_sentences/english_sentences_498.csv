The aim of this research is the study of physical characteristics of Tani banana leaf cup deforming with PCM does contribute heat to the upper mold and lower mold.
Cup’s diameter was 11 cm and deep 6 cm.
Three heaters each 300 W were heated paraffin which distributed to the mold.
The controlling handle forced banana leaf to deform.
"Results of the experiment to increase the compression time to heat up, the container to be shaped closer to mold, but may not be perfect."
Increasing the number of layers of banana leaves by using perpendicular fibers horizontally in each layer increases the durability of the container.
Although it may not be suitable for commercial use as the cost increases and the appearance of the container is too thick may not be suitable for use.
"The increasing the molding temperature It will help forming banana leaves easier, does not Does not cause torn banana leaves both inside and outside and no dehydration occurs during the water filling test which is the main factor that helps the container to be durable and stable."
"From analyzing the economic value, it was found that the hot extrusion of the banana leaf container at 115 °C, the number of banana leaves in 3 layers and the compression time of 2 minutes, they are minimum payback period is 11 months."
"In the future, the use of hydraulic systems will be improved instead of levers to achieve stable compression and study the proportion of glue that is suitable for the container."
