The objective of this research was to study the thermoelectric systems for food delivery temperature control.
Food preservation containers were designed to be able to warm food.
This is to increase food safety in food delivery business.
The main tools consist of two modules of THC1-12706 thermoelectric module and FK934 temperature cutting cycle.
The condition of the heat sink was set at 70 °C.
"The experiment was conducted and the data were collected and divided into (1) measuring the maximum temperature of the heat spreader inside a food preservation container to find the average temperature of the two food examples, dry food (egg fried rice) and liquid food (soup), by using the food preservation containers and without using the food preservation containers, and (2) measuring the energy consumed by the food preservation containers."
"The result of experiment showed that (1) the highest temperature inside the heat spreader was at 72.97 °C, and the average temperature was at 68.27 °C, and the standard deviation was 0.47."
"The average temperature of the example of dry food (egg fried rice) in the food preservation containers was 56.44°C, while the average temperature of the dry food without the food preservation containers was 42.29°C."
"For the liquid food (soup), it was found that the average temperature of the food in the food preservation containers was 55.83°C, while the average temperature of the food without the food preservation containers was 42.41°C."
"(2) The average electrical energy consumed was 3.68 A and the average electric power was 44.13 W. The electrical energy consumed was approximately 0.04 kW-h. From the testing, it was found that the food preservation container can be used to warm the food at the temperature higher than 50 °C and this had no effect on the taste of the food."
"In addition, the bacteria could also be destroyed at the temperature of 50 °C."
"Based on food safety criteria, this was found proper for food delivery business and this increases safety for consumers."
