This research aims to study the compressive strength development of motor mixed with ground rice husk ash.
There are two grindings: 2-hour grinding and 4-hour grinding.
Cement was replaced by 25% and 50%.
Mortars were cast by using w/b 0.65.
"The results showed that the 90-day mortar with 25% cement replacement with ground rice husk ash for 4 hours (M70RHA-4-25) showed the highest compressive strength, 298.88 ksc."
"On the other hand, the mortar, M50RHA-4-50, showed the lowest compressive strength, 257.06 ksc."
"In this study, it was also found that the replacement by 25% with 2-hour and 4-hour ground rice husk ash could be under the regulations of Pozzolana materials according to ASTM C 618 standard."
"However, the replacement by 50% with 2-hour and 4-hour ground rice husk ash could not be under the regulations of Pozzolana materials according to ASTM C 618 standard."
