"Bananas are one of the most economically viable crops, being planted in every region and yielding annually."
A section of the trunk contains high-quality fibers.
but are not being used as effectively as they may be.
"The aim of this study was to compare the physical qualities of fibers derived from banana trunks (Banana Fibers) to those of synthetic fibers mixed with lightweight cellular concrete with a density of 1,200 kg/m3."
"The fiber ratio used 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 kg/m3, the fiber length 19 mm., and the test sample size 15 X 15 X 15 cm."
and 30 X 30 X 5 cm.
"In a laboratory for testing, it was discovered that the compressive strength of concrete block combined with banana fibers 0.5 (BF10-05) was 30.86 kg/cm2 higher than that of concrete block mixed with synthetic fibers."
"When mixed with banana fibers 0.5 (BF10-0.5), the water absorption rate was 4.9% lower than mixed with synthetic fibers."
Similar result on thermal conductivity coefficients were observed for banana fibers 0.5 (BF10-05) and synthetic fibers.
The heat retention test with an experimental box revealed that the lightweight cellular concrete with banana fibers 0.5 (BF10-05) had a lower heat retention value than the concrete block and common brick by 1.86 to 8 degrees Celsius.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 2000-5000x magnification was used to examined the distribution of banana fibers in lightweight cellular concrete.
From the observation of the banana fibersâ€™s scattering and their arrangement.
It shown that the banana fibers can be mixed well into the lightweight cellular concrete as effective as synthetic fibers without damaging the cavitation walls of the foam bubble structure.
"In result, the physical qualities of lightweight cellular concrete mixed with banana fibers perform better in numerous tests than synthetic fibers and also excess of the TIS.2601-2556 industry benchmark."
