"This research study investigated the potential use of Sugar Cane Bagasse Ash, which is by-products from sugar industry, for material substitution in civil engineering works."
Sugar Cane Bagasse Ash (SCA) used in this study was brought from Khon Kaen Sugar Industry Public Company Limited (KSL PLC.)
"The Modified Compaction of SCA mixed with cement at ratios of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% by dry weight was studied."
The results showed that compaction characteristics of cement-mixed sugar cane bagasse ash was visibly obvious.
Cement assisted for better ability to compaction of the materials.
Cement-mixed SCA was coagulated by cementing materials and became clod-like materials.
Experimental results showed the range of Maximum Dry Density (MDD) was between 1300 kg/m3 and 1500 kg/m3.
The average MDD more than 1400 kg/m3 was determined.
The value of MDD of the compacted materials indicated the potential use as materials for the road constructions.
"Compacting water content of 25% was used to prepare specimens for measuring engineering properties, i.e., the values of uniaxial compressive strength and CBR."
The experimental results showed that strength of SCA mixed with of cement between 4% and 10% by dry weight was sufficient to the requirement for subbase and base courses of roads according to the Department of Highways (DOH) standard
