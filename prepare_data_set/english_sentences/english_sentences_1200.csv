Biodieselproduction withtransesterificationprocessusing mechanical agitator toblendtheingredients for the reaction used the reaction time more than 60 min.
And biodiesel purity wasobtained for commercial biodiesel standard.
The aim of this research was to develop a blendingprocess of the materials in biodiesel production for reducing the reaction time.
"The two typesof impeller: 45⁰ two-blade paddle and 6-blade disc turbine, were used to blend the ingredientsthat installed on a shaft in the reactor."
"For the experiments, the impeller speed was operatedfor mixing with 400 and 600 rpm, respectively."
The suitable impeller speed was investigated tofind the effect on biodiesel production.
"The results indicated that under condition: 30 L of used vegetable oil, 30 vol.% of MeOH, 5 g/LOIL of NaOH, 60 ⁰C of the reaction time, and 600 rpm ofthe impeller speed, were obtained the yield of 93.33% and the purity of 97.31 wt.% for 15 minof the reaction time."
