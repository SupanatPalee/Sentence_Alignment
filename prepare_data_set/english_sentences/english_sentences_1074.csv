This research aim to Pneumatic rambutan seed boring machine the objective is to test the performance and evaluate the performance of the semi-automatic rambutan boring machine.
"Test rambutan results with a diameter between 37-40 mm, 20 nut at a time."
"It has an average diameter of 39.08 ± 3.90 mm, a height of 50.28 ± 5.02 mm, and a total weight of 37.83 ± 3.78 grams."
"15.96 ± 1.59 grams of rambutan bark, 3.83 ± 0.38 grams of rambutan and 12.54 ± 1.25 grams of rambutan plup."
"The results showed the average rambutan boring performance, average rambutan bark 42.09% rambutan average 10.18%, average grain texture 8.88%, rambutan average 33.10%, average loss of 5.80% per total rambutan weight used in the test."
"Performance Assessment 61.80% Running Efficiency 98.33% Productivity 88.99% Overall Efficiency 77.86% Machine Capacity 1,945.95 nuts per hour Machine Efficiency 89%"
