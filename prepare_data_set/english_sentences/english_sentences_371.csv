The competition in material handling systems when international companies enter the Thai market is very challenging.
"Therefore, they bring high-efficiency material handling equipment to compete with the Thai manufacturers."
"As a result, Thai manufacturers have to accelerate their development to have comparable performance and competitive prices."
This research aims to present a method to reduce costs and add value to a cross-transfer conveyor design.
This work uses value engineering techniques to evaluate the efficiency and cost of the equipment.
"There are seven essential phases for implementing value engineering: the project selection phase, data collection phase, function analysis phase, creation phase, evaluation phase, investigation phase, and recommendation phase."
"By using this technique to redesign improvements, the new cross transfer drive can reduce the number of parts from the original 23 pieces, resulting in a 25% of reduction in assembly time, a 10% reduction in structural material weight, and a reduction in cost 30% with a value index of 1.50."
