This paper presents a new locomotion concept for a reconfigurable Spherical Robot.
The robot is a spherical shape that can be transformed into two hemispherical shapes with three omnidirectional wheels.
Each side of hemispherical shapes can split into three shell segments where each segment is connected to a leg with three degrees of freedom.
At the tip of each leg kept inside this shell is equipped with an omnidirectional wheel.
The robot can perform two locomotions: (1) rolling using shell transformation and (2) moving with three omnidirectional wheels.
The test results show that this robot can go forward with rolling using shell transformation and moving with three omnidirectional wheels successfully.
