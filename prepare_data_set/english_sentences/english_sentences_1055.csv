This research paper presents control of harmonics in single-phase electrical systems for residential buildings with shunt active power filtering mechanisms.
This research was conducted in order to filter distorted currents from the sine wave form caused by nonlinear-load supply in a residential building.
They cause harmonics in the electrical system which influence the performance of the power grid system.
"In this research, the principles of the mechanism presented by the program MATLAB/ Simulink were tested, and the created prototype equipment was compared."
This was to verify the presented system.
The results of the system simulation showed that the harmonic generation (THD) could be reduced to be only 25.48%.
This is verified that the mechanism can work as intended.
