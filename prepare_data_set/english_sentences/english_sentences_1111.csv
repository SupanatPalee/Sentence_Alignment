This research aimed to design a warehouse layout and determine the storage location for a company's warehouse.
A study of the current warehouse shows that the space management and the storage location were insufficient.
"Therefore, warehouse activities was delayed."
"To solve this problem, a mathematical model was adopted and modified according to the direction of the warehouse design."
"By considering the distances required to move goods, the proposed model provided two schematic designs for an improved warehouse layout and sufficient storage capacity in the rack storage system."
The transverse schematic delivered a lower distance compared with the longitudinal schematic for determining a more suitable storage location.
This new storage location reduced the total distance required to move goods by 18.5%.
