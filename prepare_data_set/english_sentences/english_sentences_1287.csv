sentences
Methodologies and computer programs exist to simulate complex industrial production and construction processes.
"For the former, Arena software provides acceptable simulation results, but has not yet been applied to clearly simulate construction processes."
Construction processes have often been simulated by the COSMOS simulator.
Construction process simulation between the Arena and COSMOS simulator programs has yet to be done.
"In this research, Arena was used to simulate two construction processes and compared to COSMOS’s simulation of the same situations."
Results were that both programs provided consistent simulations.
"Arena simulated construction processes closely, and COSMOS accurately compared to Arena’s findings."
"Modelling methodologies of the programs were also juxtaposed, to reveal differences and precision of construction process simulation."
