"In this research, the structural behavior of masonry walls under lateral in-plane loading was evaluated."
The goal was to develop an effective construction detail for the wall-reinforced concrete frame connection to increase lateral load resisting performance and reduce structural damages of the seismic-resistant structures.
Masonry wall structural components were tested under in-plane horizontal cyclic loads.
Finite element analysis was also carried out to evaluate the structural behavior of the tested specimens and masonry infilled reinforced concrete frames.
"Based on the results, the load transfer capability of the wall-beam connection had a significant effect on the load resisting performance and damage level of the wall."
Utilizing steel shear dowels and reinforced concrete tie beam at the wall-beam connection showed a suitable load transfer capability.
"Once the transferred load exceeds a certain threshold, a slip between wall and beams can occur, and consequently, reduce the wallâ€™s damages."
"Applying a proposed construction detail and providing the gap between wall and columns, the lateral stiffness and strength of the structural system significantly increased, compared with those of the bare frame."
"Moreover, the column shear failure due to the wall-frame interaction force was eliminated."
