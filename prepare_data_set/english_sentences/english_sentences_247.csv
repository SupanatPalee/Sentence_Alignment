sentences
This paper proposes electricity scheduling strategy for home energy management system based on the hybrid photovoltaic - battery management system.
"Objective to reduce the cost of electrical energy, the maximum power demand and extends battery life."
"Under the condition of energy balance, solar energy and battery capacity."
In simulation model the daily load profiles and the time of use rate (TOU) tariff are considers.
The results show that the system with the Particle Swam Optimization technique and the Fuzzy Logic Control application can reduce the energy cost in significantly.
"In addition, the simulation carried out to verify the usefulness of the proposed system to improve the home energy management system by reducing the peak demand."
