This research was to construct the relationship equation between the geometric ratios and the natural frequencies of [0/90]s laminated rectangular plates with three edges clamped and the other edge free.
The natural frequencies with the geometric ratios from 1.00: 1.00 to 5.00: 1.00 of composite rectangular plate obtained from the approximate method to create the relationship equation between the geometric ratios and the natural frequencies by using the regression analysis method.
The results showed that The natural frequencies can be predicted by the seventh order polynomial equation with a deviation from the approximate method of 0.3%.
