The heat transfers and pressure loss between the circular tube heat exchanger installed Delta-Winglet Tape (DWT) and the Perforated Delta-Winglet Tape (P-DWT) were compared.
The winglet inclination angle (a) was kept at 45o.
Two winglet blockage ratios (BR) of 0.20 and 0.30 were examined.
"Three relative winglet pitches (PR: 1, 2, and 3) were conducted."
The experiment was conducted in the tube heat exchanger having a uniform heat flux wall.
"Air was used as the working fluid flowing through the tube for a Reynolds number of about 4,300 â€“ 24,000."
"The heat transfer and pressure loss were presented in terms of Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f), respectively."
"From the experiment, it was found that the Nu and f were increased as increasing BR and decreasing PR."
"For comparison of the DWT and P-DW, the DWT wing gave a higher Nu value than the P-DWT due to the effect of bores on the P-DWT."
"Although the intensity of the fluid flow passing the P-DWT was slightly reduced, a decreased heat transfer was obtained."
"In contrast, the f value of the P-DWT can be reduced better than the DWT resulting in the thermal enhancement factor (TEF) of the P-DWTs gave higher than the DWT."
The TEF of the P-DWT was in the range of 0.69-1.12 and the maximum TEF regarded as the optimum point was achieved at BR = 0.30 and PR = 0.10.
