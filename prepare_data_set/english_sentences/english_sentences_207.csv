This Water turbine is the fluid machinery that changes kinetic energy of water into mechanical energy for electricity generation.
The objectives of this research are to study flow of water inside water turbine wheel using computational fluid dynamics employing Finite Volume Method.
Finite Volume Method was used to calculate velocities in the water turbine base on k-epsilon and k-omega model.
Number of Element is an important variable affecting calculation accuracy.
"Then, the accuracy of element was studied and comparison was made with results from experiment and free spinning simulation."
"The calculation result of CFD show that the elements efficiency of 80 % results in the maximum rotation speeds of a 212-213 RPM at 7 m/s, calculated by k-epsilon and k-omega model, which shows percent error of 0.46% as compared to the actual testing."
