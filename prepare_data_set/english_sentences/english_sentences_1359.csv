This paper presents the design and implementation of a motor speed control system for an automatic cutting and wrapping machine.
The idea is to reduce the cost of purchasing expensive machinery.
The prototype machine will have the ability to automatically cut and wrap the small products.
The aim of this work is to create a prototype automatic motor speed controller in order to control the motor speed up and down for an automatic candy cutting and wrapping machine.
This work leads to reduce the weight of uneven candy pellets and reduce defects in the production line.
"The dimensions of the machines in the factory are width 63 cm., length 170 cm., height 130 cm."
"and the dimensions of the prototype kits are width 50 cm., length 50 cm., height 40 cm."
using an Arduino Uno R3 Controller for controlling the main operations.
And the motor speed can be adjusted according to the distance of the sugar lines used for cutting to the pellet candy and to apply a set of sensors and IoT systems to use with smartphone.
The experimental results at a speed of 450 rpm were compared between the motor speed and the candy weight loss.
The results of the candy weight are closed to the standard as 7.5 grams/pellet.
"And when comparing the results of the waste before and after working with the machine's working time of 7 hours/day, it was found that after Improvements can reduce the amount of waste by approximately 275 pieces per day."
