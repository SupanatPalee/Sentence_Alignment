The objective was to compare the efficiency of the spraying lubricant pattern on the aluminum die-casting molds for motorcycle brakes shoes production on a 6-cavities mold with a 125-ton injection machine.
"The research methodology has been conducted by setting the independence variable is the pattern of spraying lubricant for 3 patterns: primitive pattern, temperature position pattern, and continuous curved movement of the hand pattern."
"The result of research it was found that the highest efficiency of the patterns was at continuous curved movement of the hand form, which results in the use of an average volume of lubricant of 84.66 ml per production cycle and does not cause the defects."
The results can be applied or set as a standard for lubricant spraying mold coating to increase work efficiency.
