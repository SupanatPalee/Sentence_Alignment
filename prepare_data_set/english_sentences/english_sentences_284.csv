"Treated effluent from the sugar mill factory has high organic matter, causing color, taste odor, and microbial regrowth."
These properties make the water objectional for water reuse.
This research investigated the removal of organic matter of treated effluent from of a sugar mill factory using two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) including Ultraviolet (UV)-H2O2 (UV-H2O2) and UV-persulfate (UV-PS).
"The effect of oxidants concentration (H2O2 or PS) at the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations to H2O2 or PS 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 to DOC and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) removal, and biodegradability (biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC)/DOC) was studied."
The result showed that an increase in the concentration of H2O2 or PS enhanced the efficiency of DOC and UV254 removals.
"At the ratio of DOC:H2O2 or DOC:PS 1:5, UV-H2O2 and UV-PS provided the highest organic removal efficiencies by 58% and 62% of UV254 removal, respectively, and 13% and 16% of DOC removal, respectively."
"UV-H2O2 and UV-PS processes at DOC:H2O2 or DOC:PS 1:1 resulted in the highest BDOC/DOC of 0.48 and 0.60, respectively (increased from 0.29)."
The increased BDOC/DOC value of water after UV-H2O2 or UV-PS processes indicated the need for biological treatment after AOPs to remove organic matter.
