The article presents the effect of cement on the index and compression properties of remolded cement-stabilized high swelling clay for clay liner material in a waste landfill.
The clay sample was high plasticity clay mixed with cement at a cement content of 10 % to 50 % by weight of dry soil.
The cement-stabilized high swelling clay was remolded at a curing time of 28 days.
Index properties and 1-D consolidation were investigated.
Cement content affected on index properties of soil samples.
"Specific gravity, free swelling ratio, liquid limit, and plastic limit of the soil sample tended to decrease with an increase in cement content."
The void ratio of remolded cement-stabilized high swelling clay increased at particular vertical stress as the cement content increased until the optimum cement content (Aw20%).
Then the void ratio of remolded cement-stabilized high swelling clay decreased as the cement content increased.
This is because the products obtained from hydration and pozzolanic reactions increase resulted in a decrease in the thickness of the diffuse double layer.
The coefficient of compressibility and permeability of the soil sample increased with an increase in cement content.
"This is because soil particles flocculate, resulting from hydration and pozzolanic reactions of cement."
The coefficient of permeability proposed by Nagaraj et al.
was not suitable for both high swelling clay and cement-stabilized high swelling clay.
"According to all consolidation test results, this paper modified the normalized equation with various swelling clay characteristics, which is useful for predicting the consolidation of other remolded clays and remolded cement-stabilized clays."
