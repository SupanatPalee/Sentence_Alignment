This research studies the germination behavior of brown rice for the development ofautomatic germination prototype for high efficiency.
It can replace the culture of a communityenterprise.
"This system consists of a heat and moisture content generator, water tray, brown rice trayand water tank."
"The automatic germination control systems included water filling, soaking, curing,leaching and controlling the temperature and relative humidity conditions."
"The germination ofjasmine rice 105 was compared between the automatic germination and the community enterprisesystem in order to analyze the appropriate germination conditions and germ length at 24 and 48 hr.In addition, it also considers the economic dimension of the germination system."
"It was found thatthe germination time of 48 hours had optimum conditions for temperature control and relativehumidity control at 35.25±0.66 °C and 53.29±2.40% RH, respectively."
"This has a significant effect ongermination percentage and the germ length was 80±6.76% and 0.83±0.041 mm, respectively."
Theywere higher than that of other germination.
"Moreover, the economic analysis of the germinationsystem found that the germination capacity of brown rice was 540 kg per year."
"This system provided16,956 Baht per year and 75,600 Baht per year of the electricity cost and the profit, respectively.Furthermore, the payback period was about 8 month and 15 days’ appropriate investments."
