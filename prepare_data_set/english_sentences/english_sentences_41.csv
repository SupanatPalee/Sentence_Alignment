This research aims to find out the comparison results of evaporation value of Class A pan with the evaporation pan model constructed as the tool of the study.
"Two evaporation model pans made from brass with 30 - centimeters diameter (300 millimeters diameter, 200 millimeters in depth and 4 millimeters in thickness) were situated in the location at The Lam Ta Khong Operation Maintenance Project, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, during March through May."
"With the similar meteorological conditions, the data was continuously collected for 3 months to compare the evaporation value of the two pans with the Class A pan at the site and with the evaporation of the Penman Equation method."
"The results showed that the average evaporation of 30 - centimeters diameter pans were approximately 15% greater than the Class A pan, Em/Epan ratio was 1.21 and the maximum average evaporation value, which was in April at 6.03 millimeter/day."
"The average evaporation of the Penman Equation was approximately 30% less than the 30 - centimeters diameter pans and the maximum average evaporation value, which was in April at 5.17 millimeter/day."
The average evaporation coefficient (Kp) of the 30 - centimeters diameter pans was at 0.76 which the only coefficient of evaporation in the summer season.
