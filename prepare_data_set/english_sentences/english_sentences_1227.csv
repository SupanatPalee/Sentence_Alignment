"The purpose of this research is to study the earthquake effect to liquefaction potential in Phayao Province, measuring 6.3 Mw, on May 5th, 2014 in Dongmada, Mae Laos, Chiang Rai."
The PGA was recorded for 0.6772 m/s2 at Phayao monitoring stations.
The study uses simplified method by Seed and Idriss (1971) and revised edition by Idriss and Boulanger (2008).
The analyzation considered by results of 15 boring logs in the area of high building and Phayao’s ancient remains.
"The research concluded that in Muang Phayao District zone with 5 boring logs by Seed and Idriss (1971) result showed the range of the factor of safety is 2.96- 6.03, Idriss and Boulanger (2008) is 2.60-5.30."
"In University of Phayao zone with 10 boring logs by Seed and Idriss (1971) result showed the range of the factor of safety is 2.02-13.06, Idriss and Boulanger (2008) is 2.60-20.56 both area has sufficient FS for resistance of the liquefaction."
"The probabilistic of liquefaction in Phayao, PL shows as 5.03% with Seed and Idriss (1971) and 2.30% with Idriss and Boulanger (2008)."
Liquefaction would not be occurred in both zones which are in the range of almost certain.
"When we plot the graph to compare FS with PL, the factor of safety is high which reflects low probability"
