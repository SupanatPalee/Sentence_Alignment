This paper presents the design and construction of smart the IoT system for modeling house controlled by microcontroller.
"This is done in the form of applying the IoT system to the modeling house to study the feasibility before using it in the real house make an ordinary home into a smart home by the application of the IoT system will consist of ESP8266 used to support network connection standards IEEE 802.11b/g/n to be able to connect to a WiFi network so that the board can connect to the Internet and use MQ-2 in gas and smoke detection, use PIR HC-SR501 to detect motion, use a light detector to monitor the working status of the lamp and control the on-off lamp with a smartphone."
"From the test, it was found that the gas and smoke detection can detect gas concentrations in the range of 10 â€“ 10,000 ppm notify via Line application, motion detection using the PIR module HC-SR501 to detect various movements can work normally within 1-4 meters notify via Line application and checking the operating status of the lamp via the Blynk application, it revealed that the sensor was rated at 23 to 24 at a distance of 30 cm and 79 to 99 at a distance of 20 cm, the on-off of the lamp via the Blynk application with a smartphone can turn on and off the lamp as needed."
"It makes greatly facilitates, comfort and reduces some of the steps in our daily lives."
