"The research aimed to study and investigate factors affecting working performance, engine power, and energy consumption of the combine harvester for off-season rice (Phitsanulok-2 cultivar)."
"This study focused mainly on 2 factors, first, driving speed at 3, 4, and 5 km / h, and second, threshing drum speed at 18.06, 20.68, and 23.30 m /s (threshing drum speed​​ at 450, 525, and 600 rpm)."
"The results can be summarized as follows; 1) Statistical analysis was used to evaluate working performance, total field loss, and harvesting-threshing power."
"The results showed significant differences of working performance and harvesting-threshing power among the factors of driving speed, threshing speed, and driving-threshing speed interaction."
"Whilst, the total field loss was influenced only by the driving speed."
"2) As an increasing of the driving speed by 4 to 5 km/ h with the threshing drum speed of 20.68-23.30 m /s, the effective working performance reached 5.94-8.79 rai/ h using the power of 17.62-23.15 kW."
"3) The continuous test of performance and power of the combine harvester revealed that at an average driving speed of 4.77 km/ h, the average effective working performance ranged from 8.06 to 8.61 rai /h with average total field loss of 4.05-4.10% by using average engine power of 16.04-16.80 kW or specific energy of 1.92-2.00 kWh/ rai, with the floating axle shaft of the threshing unit of 11.12-14.35 kW, the conveyor axle shaft of 1.79-2.19 kW, and the header axle shaft of 0.41-0.46 kW."
