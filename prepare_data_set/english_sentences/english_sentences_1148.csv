sentences
This research aims to study on kinetics of dye treatment from industrial dye wastewater using ozone with manganese dioxide on alumina powder.
"The treatments were divide into three processes: ozonation, catalysis and catalytic ozonation."
"The optimization conditions studied on pH 4, 6 and 8 with 5 mg/min ozone consumption while, catalyst loading 2.5 and 5 g The result showed by ozonation process successfully degraded 95% in 40 minutes of azo dye under conditions pH 8 and 2.5 g catalyst loading."
The reaction followed second-order reaction with constant 30.0 x 10-5 ADMI-1 L min-1.
