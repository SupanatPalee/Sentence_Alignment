This research aimed to study the effect of using bottom ash as fine aggregate in concrete towards the compressive strength of high strength concrete.
The water binder ratio was 0.35.
"The replacement ratios of bottom ash as fine aggregate were 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% by volume of fine aggregate."
"The replacement ratios of using fly ash as Portland Cement were 0%, 10%, and 30% by volume of cement."
The results of the compressive strength test at 28 days (14 days curing in water) showed that the compressive strength was higher than that of the control concrete when the ratio of bottom ash was not exceeded 30%.
It had a maximum compressive strength of 514.8 kg/cm2.
"When fly ash was partially used to replace concrete, it showed that only 10% of fly ash as partial cement replacement had higher compressive strength than that of the control concrete."
