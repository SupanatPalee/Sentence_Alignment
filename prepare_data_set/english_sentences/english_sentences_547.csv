This research aims to find an approach of tableting production management in a pharmaceutical industry for increasing productivity and applying mathematical models to determine the optimal production size that gives the lowest total cost.
This study investigates the production process of product A which is the top-selling tablet of a generic pharmaceutical manufactory that tends to be sold over its production capacity in the near future.
"Therefore, this study will focus on studying how to move current production line to new line with lower machine utilization rates and increase the lot-size of the production to three times base on the capacity of the mixer."
"As a result, the average standard time used in the production of product A with a new line decrease to 0.036 second per tablet, and the productivity increases significantly from the previous production lines to 60%."
"Moreover, when applying the mathematical models to determine the optimal number of lot in each campaign, it was found in the granulation process that product AÂ  which uses the same machine as the other three products, namely product E, product G and product R should be planed to mix 18 lots of product A continuously every 12 days, the product E should be mixed 12 lots continuously every 16 days, the product G should be mixed 6 lots continuously every 7 days, and product R should be mixed 12 lots continuously every 10 days."
"To sum up, the total cost of production and holding is 84,653.92 baht / month."
"The tableting process of product A which uses the same machine as the other two products, namely product C and product H should be planed to compress 4 lots of product A continuously every 20 days, the product C should be compressed 5 lots continuously every 17 days, and product H should be mixed 6 lots continuously every 17 days."
"To sum up, the total cost of production and holding is 171,439.4 baht/month."
