"The structural design against impact loading is generally used impact factor to increase capacity of structural member, which may not be very accurate."
"This is because the impact force, reaction force, and especially inertia force are occurred in structural member under impact load, which are not considered in static problem."
"In this research, the impact behavior of 9 simple beams, including reinforced concrete beams (RC) and rectangular concrete-filled steel tube beams (CFST) designed to have same load capacities and hollow steel beams (HS), under dropped steel hammer 160 kg from 700 mm height were observed."
The results revealed that the most of impact force in early stage was absorbed by inertia force.
The CFST beams which have elastic stiffness less than RC beams significantly showed the well impact loading performance.
They can reduce the impact forced more than 7 times compared to RC beams with same load capacities and also reduced the reaction force from colliding events.
The RC beams reached the brittle failure and HS beams occurred the local buckling at the impact point.
"Nevertheless, CFST beams did not demonstrate any damage."
These results illustrate that CFST beams are appropriate to resist impact load.
