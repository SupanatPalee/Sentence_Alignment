This paper described an evaluation of the multiple criteria traffic and transportation environmental impact on the Central Business District (CBD) road networks in the city of Khon Kaen.
The Mathematical Model Method (MMM) approach was adopted to estimate the levels of traffic and transportation environmental impacts of 39 road segments for 3 factors including (1) CO concentrations; (2) Noise levels and (3) Pedestrian accident risk.
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was also applied to calculate the Composite Environmental Impact Scores (CEIS) of those 39 road segments.
"The computed CEIS can be used to prioritize each road segment according to its degree of multiple criteria traffic & Transport environmental impacts, specify the problem locations and identify the likely causes of such problems."
The results of research show that those road segments with high CEIS values are road segment No.
"9, 10, 11 and 12 and traffic noise levels are the main cause of such problems."
These findings can be used to assist decision makers to prioritize and relevantly and effectively allocate their limited budgets for solving problems.
