The objective of this research is to compare the yield of oyster mushrooms that have different environmental control conditions.
Four conditions are managed by supervisory control algorithm to control a fan and water nozzle.
"Time, temperature, and humidity are the parameters of our interest."
"The yields obtained from supervisory control algorithm in the condition 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 42.97 ± 11.16, 51.24 ± 10.09, 56.44 ± 9.85 and 55.26 ± 14.96 g/unit where the seed germination percentage are 83%, 87%, 91% and 89%, respectively."
"The results also show that different conditions cause different seed germination rates which are 42.38, 51.56, 55.49 and 51.52 g/unit/day, respectively."
"Therefore, the study has shown using temperature and humidity to cooperate with typical conditions in controlling equipment in the growth house helps increase yield that conditions 3 cause the highest yield."
