This paper presents a study of the relationship between accumulation rainfall and soil landslide time on a physical earth slope model .Soil samples were collected from the soil landslide sites and tested for basic engineering properties of two soil masses and the rainfall from previous researches was more than 100 millimeters per day.
"As a result, soil landslide on the slope and two slope models were used."
The slope was 160 hours per slope.
To study cumulative settlement patterns and cumulative lengths.
"Based on the results of the study, the basic properties of soil samples can be USCS classified is SM."
"the results show that when the rainfall accumulation reaches a period of 48 hours, the two slopes will collapse and the cracks will follow."
Low water permeability will initiate sudden slump and low slope.
"Over long periods of time, soil will continue to subsist more and more."
"And based on the cumulative crack length study, it is evident that soil with high water permeability on slope increases with the cumulative length of cracks."
"At the same time, soil with low water permeability should be monitored and preventive measures should be taken."
