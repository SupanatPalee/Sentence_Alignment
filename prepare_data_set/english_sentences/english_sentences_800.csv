This research proposed a daily production planning method for an automobile body part pressing machine by using 4-stages mixed integer linear programming model.
This research proposed four steps for lot sizing determination.
The first stage aims to minimize the maximum tardiness.
The second stage uses for minimizing the total weighted tardiness.
The third stage uses for maximizing the average earliness.
The final stage determines production volumes for each part with minimizing the total cost of holding cost and setup cost as the objective.
"Next, the decision variables corresponding to the part delivery of the final model were utilized to build the production schedules."
The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing with the real production plan of 20 days.
The results revealed that the optimal solutions were found for all models of all problems.
The total cost was reduced 1.58% and the average completion times of parts produced in their shipping period before delivery were met the delivery restriction.
The average computational time for creating the daily production plan was less than one minute comparing to 108 minutes of previous method.
