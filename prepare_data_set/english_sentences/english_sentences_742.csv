This research study was aimed to study the planning and development of gas-fired infrared tunnel dryer with airflow reversal technique.
This work was presented with the dried mango as the product case study.
The study was divided into two approaches.
"First, planning and finding a solution to improve the drying management to achieve the effectiveness of drying mango."
"Second, finding the conceptual solution to improve the problem of airflow and temperature distribution in the dryer by using the computation fluid dynamic (CFD) program as a tool."
The result of the first approach was found that the management of drying duration and looping the moist product to repeat the drying can improve the product quality and increase drying efficiency.
"For the second approach, the result was found the CFD can use as an effective tool for solving the problem and predicting the irregular airflow and temperature distribution in the dryer."
"Moreover, this approach could be reduced labor cost for transportation of trucks in drying process around 10 percent which was applied as an option for further improvement."
