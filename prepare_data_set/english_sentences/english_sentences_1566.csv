This research was to study the genetic diversity of some plants in the genus Globba by using RAPD markers combined with basic plant morphology.
The morphological characters of the nine accessions were obtained DNA extraction by using the modified CTAB technique from Doyle & Doyle (1987).
The DNA amplification was executed by using a PCR RAPD technique and analyzed the genetic association with UPGMA method.
"The result showed that the DNA could be amplified with 4 of 25 primers includes OPA-03, OPC-05, OPC-06 and OPX-12 primers."
Total 141 DNA bands could be detected with size approximately 250-2500 base pair.
"Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis shown an interval 0.420-0.938 and resulting in plant categorized into two groups."
"These are correlated with the plant morphology, by the staminode and appendages characters."
"The first group has a staminode extending off the floral tube and has two pairs of appendages, Globba siamensis (Hemsl.)"
Hemsl.
"The second group has a staminode clinging to the floral tube and has with or without two pairs of appendages, Globba laeta K. Larsen, Globba sp., and Curcuma angustifolia Roxb."
"However, the RAPD marker is useful for classifying plants within the genus Globba and closely related other genera."
