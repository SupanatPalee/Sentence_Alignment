"Preparation of activated carbons from santol peel and chili stem by chemical activation with zinc chloride, phosphoric acid, ferric chloride and potassium hydroxide and physical activation with carbon dioxide has been carried out in this study."
The prepared activated carbons were characterized surface area and porosity analyses.
It was found that activated carbon with highest surface area of 577 m2/g has been obtained by phosphoric acid activation of santol peel with the total pore volume of 0.447 cm3/g and average pore size of 3.10 nm with the micropore volume of 58.2%.
"For activated carbons from chili stem, activation with zinc chloride exhibits the highest surface area of 400 m2/g with the total pore volume 0.270 cm3/g and average pore size of 2.70 nm with mainly micropore volume of 70%."
The prepared activated carbons from santol peel and chili stem shows higher surface area values than many raw materials.
"Therefore, agricultural wastes such as santol peel and chili stem has potential as raw materials for production of activated carbon."
