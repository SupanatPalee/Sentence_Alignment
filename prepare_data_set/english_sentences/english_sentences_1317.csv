"An anaerobic wastewater treatment pond of palm oil extraction plant is a source of hydrogen sulfide gas, that may spread and cause trouble to nearby residents."
The objective of this research was to analyze the location of the wastewater treatment pond of the palm oil extraction plant in Chumphon province with a capacity of 360 tons of fresh palm per day.
This research was conducted using ALOHA program to analyze the radius of dispersion of hydrogen sulfide gas.
"The result stated the radius of dispersion of gas at the level of the general public (AEGL-1) as follows: (1) the wind from the north had a distance along the wind direction of 3.4 km, with a perpendicular to the wind direction of 0.32km., (2) the wind from the west, a distance was 1.8 km, with a perpendicular to the wind direction of 0.29 km., and (3) the wind from the east, a distance was 1.4 km, with a perpendicular to the wind direction of 0.32 km."
"However, considering the minimal impact on the community, the pond should not be located in the north of the nearby residents for less than 3.4 km."
"Likewise, the radius of dispersion should be determined again for a different capacity, and the pond should not locate in the north of the nearby residents for less than the radius of dispersion as well."
