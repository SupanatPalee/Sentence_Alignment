sentences
"Advancement in microelectronics technology has been a rise in the interest for recording low amplitude, low frequency signals for neuroscience applications."
"For the use of biological system, the recording biological system consists of large number of electrodes called ‘micro-electrode arrays (MEA)’ capable of recording signals from neural sites."
The neural site consists of weak amplitude signals arising from nervous system.
"Because of their weak amplitude, they are first required to be processed by a neural amplifier with a high mid-band gain before further conditioning of the signals."
One of the prime requisite for a neural amplifier is having good noise efficiency mainly because of the presence of background noise during recording.
The input referred noise has to be very low for clear recording of neural signal.
"Based on the current trend, low power design is also a must."
An important performance metric of a Neural Amplifier is the noise efficiency factor.
