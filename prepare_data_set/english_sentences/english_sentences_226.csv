"Rotary mixer is used for mixing bulk materials in the direction of rotation about a horizontal axis, and found in agriculture and other industries related to mixing processes."
Discrete Element Method (DEM) technique was employed to investigate the mixing of solid particles in a plastic mixer of rotary machine.
The present technologies of DEM were applied for mathematical modeling process for analysis and design of rotary mixer.
"In order to achieve this goal, this study analyzed the efficiency of DEM technique and illustrated the particle model by using DEM for predicting the bulk materials moving in the plastic mixing."
"DEM technique was used for check-up process of velocity, mass flow rate and the behavior of plastics material movement for rotation in plastics mixer and plastics materials resistance during the operation along the horizontal length of the rotary mixer."
It is found that the mixing domain was discretized using the simulation grid system with the minimum cell size of 2.5R as the samples.
The data from simulation were validated with the experimental data for ensuring the accuracy of the results.
