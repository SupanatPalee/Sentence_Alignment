"This study, comparing gray oyster mushroom production in a smart farm and a traditional farm had two objectives: 1."
To compare the mushroom production in a smart farm and a traditional farm; and 2.
To compare the mushroom production from different arrangements of mushroom lumps.
"For this research, Internet of Things technology and measurement equipment were installed to control 4 factors of oyster mushroom production: 1."
Relative humidity 70 - 90%; 2.
Temperature 28 - 32Â°C; 3.
"CO2 content less than 2,000 ppm; and 4."
Light 100 lux.
The research design divided the smart farm into 4 zones to record the results of mushroom production in each zone.
"In zones 1A and 1B, the mushroom cultures were arranged in 2 layers vertically, with a gap of 1 layer, and in zones 2A and 2B, the mushroom clusters were arranged in the traditional way, by placing the mushroom clusters on top of each other vertically."
The mushroom production in the smart farm was higher than the traditional farm (24.18-26.51%).
"When adjusting the arrangement, 2 layers vertically, with a gap of 1 layer, it was found that production in the smart farm was higher than the traditional farm (33.81 - 35.86%)."
"This shows that production in the smart farm was higher than the traditional farm and the arrangement of 2 layers, with a gap of 1 layer, gives better results than the traditional arrangement."
