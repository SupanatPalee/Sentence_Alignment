"There is a large demand to export rubberwood in the furniture industries of Thailand, which has major rubberwood resources in its southern areas."
"This research studied two different methods for drying rubberwood and specifically drying kinetics, modeling, effective moisture diffusivity, and wood drying rate in a microwave oven."
"In the experiments, the same size of a piece of rubberwood as typically used in a factory, and two different approaches were applied to dry the pieces of rubberwood to reduce their moisture content."
"Drying control was regulated by microwave power, which adjusted the microwave power from high to low within 90 min and 150 min."
"The airflow was either 1.5 m/s or 3.0 m/s, and microwave power ranged between 0.85 and 2.6 kW."
The highest temperature was 81.5 °C.
The results indicated that moisture was removed very quickly in the first period due to the high power of the microwave drying method.
"The logarithmic model of schedule 1 was the most accurate representation of the drying kinetics of the microwave as compared to the experimental data, and this model had an R2 coefficient of 0.9999 to describe the drying process."
"The effective diffusivity of the moisture ranged from 1.518×10-9 และ 1.572×10-9 m2/mins, respectively."
"Microwave drying of rubberwood removed the moisture content inside the wood and reduced the internal stress of the wood, both of which accelerated wood drying."
