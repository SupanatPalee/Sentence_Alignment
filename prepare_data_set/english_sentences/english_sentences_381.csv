Using the sol-gel technique with basil seed mucilage as a chelating agent.
"Study of the correlation between the gel concentration and magnetic parameters such as saturated magnetization (Ms), remanence magnetization (Mr), coercivity (Hc), and squareness."
The final product of the sol-gel reaction is used to measure thermal behavior with TGA.
The calcine temperature was then set to prepare the samples at 600Â°C for 10 hours.
The cobalt ferrite phase is fully visible in the XRD pattern when the gel concentration is 20% or higher.
The sample shows up as a flake in the SEM image and transforms into a larger cluster as the gel concentration increases.
