This research aim was to study the feasibility of the preparation of a pyrometric cone made from raw materials in Lampang province which was used to validate the temperature in a ceramic kiln.
The research team started the experiment by analyzing chemical and mineral composition (XRF and XRD) of a commercial-grade pyrometric cone.
"Then, following a pyrometric formulation in accordance with the Thailand Industrial Standard (TISI) 558, the kiln was fired at 1230Â° Celsius in an oxidation atmosphere."
"It was found that the cone consisted of silica (50%), limestone (10%), and feldspar (40%)."
It gave an accurate result and the price is cheaper than the standard cones by 10%.
