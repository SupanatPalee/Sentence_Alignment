This paper aims to study performance of turbidity removal of the clarification water in water treatment plant by sludge blanket clarifier.
"By controlling coagulant dosing rate, the results between pre-chlorination and no pre-chlorination addition on turbidity removal efficiency of the clarifier were compared."
Experimental results found that the pre-chlorination addition was significantly affected on turbidity removal efficiency for the clarification water.
The pre-chlorination addition provided higher turbidity removal efficiency than the no pre-chlorination addition.
"For, the pre-chlorination addition, turbidity removal efficiency was 86.3% ±1.7%."
For the no pre-chlorination addition turbidity removal efficiency was 81.5% ±2.8%.
Because of the pre-chlorination addition showed higher a decreased pH than the no pre-chlorination addition.
The increasing in residual chlorine from the clarified water enhanced increasing of turbidity removal efficiency in polynomial relation.
"At a 18-mg/l alum dosage, the optimum residual chlorine from the clarified water was in range 0.12-0.16 mg/l which provided highest turbidity removal efficiency."
The optimum residual chlorine enhanced turbidity removal efficiency about 2.7% ±1%.
