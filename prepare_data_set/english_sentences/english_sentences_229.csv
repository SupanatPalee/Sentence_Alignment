"The business being studied sold home decor items at its physical stores, each of which came with its own selling and marketing techniques."
"As marble items were unique in their own way, coupled with the unpredictable needs, they were usually displayed at the stores in large numbers to avoid the loss of sales opportunity - which in turn resulted in overstocking."
"In this study, a new method was proposed to improve the companyâ€™s inventory policy, making it more systemic and better organized."
Results from the proposed inventory policy were estimated using the order-up-to level (OUL) model.
"The order intervals were set at two and four weeks, and given the optimal order quantity (Q*), 99.90% cycle service level, and the fixed lead time of one week - the analysis was made with factors such as limitations and selling methods of each of the stores, as well as the unpredictable needs for the home decor items, all being taken into account."
