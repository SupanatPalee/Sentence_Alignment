sentences
A self-healing geopolymer containing encapsulated bacteria in alginate beads was successfully performed to protect high alkalinity during the geopolymer casting.
"In this study, Bacillus pseudofirmus was incubated for 5 days in broth medium and mixed with 0.5 % w/v sodium alginate before dropped through the 0.8 mm diameter needle by an extrusion technique."
"Afterwards, the encapsulated cells in alginate beads were immersed in 10, 11 and 12 M NaOH and total released cell numbers were counted by haemocytometer to determine the number of dead cells."
"It was found that the dead cells were 8.67±8.67%, 40.58±12.79%, 92.59±3.71% in 10, 11, 12 M NaOH solution respectively after being exposed for 80 minutes."
"However, the number of non-encapsulated dead cells reached the highest point within 20 minutes."
"Therefore, the encapsulation has proved to be able to protect cells by having an increase in the survival rate of Bacillus pseudofirmus in sodium alginate beads."
The geopolymer containing these encapsulated beads by 10% and 20% showed no negative effects on the compressive strength according to Fisher’s exact statistic method (p<0.05).
