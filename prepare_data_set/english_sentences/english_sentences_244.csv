This research is aimed to propose a prediction equation for the stiffness of pile spring (K) ​​in case of bored piles for the design of high-rise building foundations in Bangkok.
The prediction equation for ratio of stiffness of pile spring including effect of surrounding soil and stiffness of pile related to its properties and size (K/(EA/L)) was studied based on data of static pile load test of bored piles in study area and simulation by 3D finite element method with calibrated by statistical analysis with pile load test data.
"The results showed that the K tends to increase as the length and diameter of pile increase, while the K/(EA/L) varies directly as the length of pile but inversely as the diameter of pile."
This research proposed the new equation for the K/(EA/L).
The prediction equation result for K/(EA/L) shows coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.880 which is considered to have very small deviations compared to the earlier prediction for K/(EA/L) which coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.365
