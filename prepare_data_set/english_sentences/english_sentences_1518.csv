"The aim of this research was to investigate the physical properties of railway ballast rock for the rock deposits in Chana district, Songkhla province such as Nahwah deposit and Tarmorsai deposit."
"The experiments was devided into 6 parts such as mineralogy, abrasion by los angeles, aggregate impact value, size distribution, specific gravity and water absorption and shape index were compared with the standard properties of State Railways of Thailand (SRT)."
The result showed that thin section from mineralogy was granite and samples from three deposits were complied with SRT’s standard.
"The abrasion value was less than 24%, bulk specific gravity and water absorption was higher than 2.6 and less than 3 percent, respectively."
"For size distribution, Tarmorsai 1 deposit and Tarmorsai 2 deposit were complied with SRT’s standard except 1 sample from Nahwah deposit."
"The elongation index of samples from Nahwah deposit, Thamorsai 1 deposit and Tarmorsai 2 deposit were grouped into C, E and E type, respectively."
"The flakiness index of samples from Nahwah deposit, Thamorsai 2 and Tarmorsai 1 were grouped into A, A and C type, respectively."
