The research aims to investigate the potential for hot water production of vapor compression heat pump together with photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T).
"The heat pump with a maximum heating capacity of 3,000 W extracted heat from each PV/T module of 1.326 m2 in parallel connection that generated a maximum heating capacity of 200 Wp."
"This study was considered the suitable sizes of PV/T module and cool water tank for hot water production volumes of 350, 500, and 700 liters at 60 Â°C every day."
"The amount of heat and electrical energy generated with various PV/T modules, and cool water sizing including the saving of electrical energy from transmission line compare with that from electrical coil for hot water production were investigated under Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen, Bangkok, and Songkhla climates."
"The result showed that the presented unit could save electrical energy over 90, 90, 70% of the transmission line, respectively."
"In term of economic analysis, the suitable numbers of PV/T modules with 300, 300, 50 L of cool water tank, respectively, were found and the payback periods were 5.70, 3.95, 4.83 years, respectively."
