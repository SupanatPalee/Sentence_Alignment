sentences
The tested flat plate solar collector was 1Â´1.5 m2 in size.
The closed-loop oscillating heat pipe (CLOHP) was made of a copper capillary tube and the distilled water was used as its working fluid.
"The effects of various parameters i.e., the solar intensity, the evaporator length of CLOHP and the number of meandering turns of CLOHP, on the thermal performance of solar collector were experimentally investigated."
The solar collector was tested under the solar simulator.
The halogen lamps were used to simulate the solar energy.
It was found from all experiments that the thermal performance of solar collector improved with an increase in the radiation intensity.
"The proper evaporator length and number of turns, for which the maximum thermal efficiency of flat plate solar collector with CLOHP was about 0.6, were 1 m and 20 turns, respectively."
