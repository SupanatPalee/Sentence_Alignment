"This research studied the preliminary utilization tests on a test bench and a local fishery boat of diesohols (diesel-alcohols) containing tall oil monoacids from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a cheap by-product of edible palm oil industry, as a diesel replacement and an emulsifier for diesohol production."
This work represented the worst case of study to utilize high free fatty acid bio-oils as diesel substitutes.
"For diesohols in this work, anhydrous ethanol (AhE) and anhydrous n-butanol (AhnB) were used as a cold flow property improver and a simultaneous part of diesel replacement."
"Diesohols studied consists of 3 formulas including PFAD20AhE5, PFAD30AhE10EHN4000, and PFAD30AhnB20, the number following PFAD and AhE/AhnB is the blending proportion of wt.% with diesel and the number following EHN (cetane improver of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate) is the blending proportion of ppm with diesohol, in which their costs were comparable to that of diesel."
"Preliminarily, the diesohols were tested in a single-cylinder diesel engine model KUBOTA RT100 DI PLUS on a test bench under high load of 6.40 kW at high speed of 2200 rpm."
It was found that all the diesohols could operate the tested engine in the same manner as diesel with slightly lower brake thermal efficiencies than diesel.
"In addition, the engine was also tested to continuously run under middle load of 3.84 kW at high speed of 2200 rpm for 90 min."
The results revealed that all the diesohols were able to continuously run the engine with the good smooth of constant speed as same as diesel.
"For preliminarily actual utilizations of the diesohols for 15 hr in a local fishery boat mounted with a single-cylinder diesel engine model YANMAR TF120 DI, it was found that all the diesohols were able to provide the acceleration required for driving the boat to tow the fishing net as same as diesel."
The overall satisfactions evaluated for the actual utilization and the suitability for actual utilization were in the levels of good-very good as same as diesel.
"In conclusion, this research explored the great opportunity for the actual utilization of diesohols containing tall oil monoacids from palm fatty acid distillate."
