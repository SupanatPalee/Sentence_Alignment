This research aims to reduce the defective rate in the painting process of motorcycle parts.
This research applied the Six Sigma approach.
"Firstly, the problem statement was defined."
"Secondly, the accuracy and precision of the inspection system were appraised."
"Next, the potential causes for crack defects were analyzed."
"Then, the four factors were statistically tested: cleaning temperature, cleaning pressure, electrodeposited paint voltage, and sanding method."
"In the improvement phase, the sanding method was improved to be both horizontal and vertical sanding."
"In addition, Box-Behnken design was applied to find out the optimal levels of the three remaining factors."
"The optimal setting was at the cleaning temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, cleaning pressure of 1.4 kilograms per square centimeter, and electrodeposited paint voltage of 180 volts."
"After that, the optimal setting was applied in the process to confirm the experimental result."
"Finally, a new control plan and work instruction were adjusted to control the process after the improvement."
"After improvement, the defective rate due to crack defects decreased from 3.82 percent to 0.98 percent."
"The improvement is expected to reduce the rework cost of 81,257 baht based on the forecasted production volume of 95,069 units in 2021."
