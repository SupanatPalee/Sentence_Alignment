"Currently in Thailand, there are a lot of heavy metals in nature because of waste releasing into nature from industrial factories without having good treatment."
"Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the adsorptive efficiency of soil that used to build waste treatment ponds for further development in the future."
"In the past, a comparative study of the adsorptive efficiency on heavy metals with various types of soil was conducted and found that the soil with the best adsorptive efficiency was clay."
"Hence, this study investigated and compared the adsorptive efficiency on various types of clay in adsorbing heavy metals."
"Three types of adsorbents including 1) Kaolinite clay 2) Illite clay and 3) Montmorillonite clay, and three types of heavy metals including 1) copper (Cu) 2) nickel (Ni) and 3) zinc (Zn) were employed in this study."
"The initial concentration of heavy metals was 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 and 6,000 ppm."
The equilibrium time of adsorption in this research was 2 days.
The method used to test the adsorptive efficiency was Batch test.
"The results of this study suggest that Montmorillonite clay have the best adsorptive efficiency, followed by Illite clay and Kaolinite clay, Montmorillonite clay can adsorb 10 times better than the other two types of clay."
"Copper is the most adsorbed heavy metal solution, follow by nickel and zinc."
The results were consistent with Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
