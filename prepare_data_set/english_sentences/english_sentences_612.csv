This article aims to study the impacts on the soil cement block from using natural latex additive as an admixture.
"Experiments were performed on soil cement blocks using two different types of soil, laterite and sandy loam."
"The soil cement block samples were prepared using different volumes of natural latex as admixture at 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 percent by weight of water."
"The properties of soil cement blocks were assessed against Thai Community Product Standards, TCPS 602/2547."
The results found that the soil cement blocks produced using finely crushed laterite enhanced with 5 percent of natural latex additive had the highest compressive strength at 10.96 MPa.
This was significantly higher than the compressive strength of soil cement block without additive at the level of 0.05 and consists of all the other properties according to the standard of the load-bearing bricks.
"The soil cement block that uses sandy loam which has no plastic limit properties, showed crack failures after press processed."
"The sample was improved using 5 percent natural latex then the property of the enhanced soil cement block showed improved properties and physical characteristics, there was no more crack failure and the product consisted of all the required characteristics of non-load baring bricks."
"The analysis of the results from this research indicated that the mechanical properties of soil cement blocks were improved with added natural latex at 5 percent, it has statistically significant higher compression strength."
The natural latex was also acted as the binding agent which enabled the soil cement block to be press processed without cracks.
"This was clearly evident for cases where the soil were well graded mixture, especially for sandy loam."
"However, the properties of soil cement blocks were primarily dependent on the type of soil and the volume of cement used in the production process."
