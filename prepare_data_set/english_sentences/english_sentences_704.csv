This research aimed to study the effects of chord line size changing and angle blade pitch adjustment on rotational speed and torque of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT).
The turbine blades used in this study were airfoil type and were in accordance with the NACA 2412.
"They were installed on three-blade VAWT set with radius rotation and height of 160 and 190 mm, respectively."
"The three-blade VAWT set was tested inside the open-type wind tunnel with the wind speeds of 1, 2 and 3 m/s."
"Then, the chord line size changing to 80, 100 and 120 mm and the angle blade were adjusted to 00, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50."
"The results showed that the rotational speed and torque were increased when the angle blade pitch was adjusted to 00, 10, and 20, and they were decreased when the angle blade pitch was adjusted to 30, 40, and 50 of all chord line sizes and wind speeds."
"In addition, 3 m / s wind speed in 80 mm chord line size has a maximum speed rotation of 759 rpm, while 120 mm chord line size has a maximum torque of 0.13 N-m."
