"This research was aimed to study the kinetics of drying raw banana chips in two solar   greenhouse systems: System 1, normal greenhouse drying; and System 2, greenhouse and supplementary heat system controlling by smart phone."
The two systems were observed and controlled via smart phone app.
and an auxiliary heat source from a heat gun.
the system was setup to dry raw bananas to find out the efficiency.
The system was able to control the specified temperatures very well via a smartphone and the drying performance could be monitored on the smartphone screen.
"The result of the quality of bananas after drying revealed that at the determined temperature, they took only 4 and 5 hours respectively where the final moisture content was at 8.01 %db."
"In term of color quality, bananas from the test had almost the same brightness (L) as raw bananas."
The overall color difference were 17.01 and 17.45.
There were no statistically significant differences (p<0.05).
"The water activities (aw) were 0.577, which were below the standard (<0.6)."
