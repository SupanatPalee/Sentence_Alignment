"The study investigated the efficiency of a biofilter to treat volatile orgamic compounds including Toluene, Xylene and Thinner which consists of 64% Toluene."
"The experiment was devided into 3 parts consisting of treatment of Toluene, Xylene and Thinner at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm and retention time of 30, 60 and 90 seconds."
"The biofilter compositions were mixture of compost, manure, wood chips and microorganism sludge having composition by volume of 60:10:20:10 respectively."
The flowrate was maintained at 6.28 liter per minute.
The results showed that treatment of 50 ppm Toluene with retention time 60 seconds yield efficiency of 100%.
"When the concentrations were increased to 100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm using retention time of 90 seconds the removal efficiency of Toluene was 98%, 91%, 86% and 78%, respectively."
Treatment of 50 ppm Xylene at 60 seconds retention time yielded efficiency of 97%.
"When Xylene concentrations were increased to 100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm using retention time of 90 seconds the removal efficiency were 99%, 97%, 93% and 86%, respectively."
Treatment of 50 ppm Thinner at 60 seconds retention time yielded efficiency of 99%.
"When Thinner concentrations were increased to 100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm using retention time of 90 seconds the removal efficiency were 99%, 96%, 87% and 71%, respectively."
