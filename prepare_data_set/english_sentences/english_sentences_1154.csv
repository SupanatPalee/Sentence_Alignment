This research aimed to study the optimal amount of Titanium dioxide (TiO2) in Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) film and to study the removal efficiency of methylene blue (MB) by photocatalytic process using TiO2/PLA film.
"The TiO2/PLA films containing TiO2 about 1 (F1), 3 (F2) and 5 (F3) %(w/w) were operated coupling with UVC."
"The result showed that MB can be degraded about 43, 50 and 37% within 60 min of reaction time when using F1, F2 and F3, respectively."
"The TOC in the water samples from F1, F2 and F3 were reduced 29, 35 and 19%, respectively."
This result indicated that MB can be mineralized to CO2 and H2O by using TiO2/PLA in photocatalytic process.
The degradation of MB was following the pseudo-first order kinetic.
"The degradation rate constants (k) were 8.9, 11.0 and 8.0 (10-3 min-1) as using F1, F2 and F3, respectively."
The k value increased when the amount of TiO2 increased as 3% (w/w) and reduction of k value occurred when the weight of TiO2 higher than 3% (w/w).
"Therefore, the optimal TiO2 in TiO2/PLA film that used to remove dye in wastewater was 3% (w/w)."
