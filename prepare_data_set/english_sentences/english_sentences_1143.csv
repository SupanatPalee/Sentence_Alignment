The objective was to investigate the performance and exhaust emission of nano-emulsified fuel (diesel-biodiesel-water blends) using an indirect injection diesel engine.
The nano-emulsified fuel of diesel-biodiesel-water was produced by using 18 kHz ultrasonic frequency of probe-type ultrasound.
"The emulsified fuel (D42B50W2) was blended with the condition of 42 vol.% diesel, 50 vol.% biodiesel, 2 vol.% water at 60 sec sonication time."
The surfactants of 3 vol.% Span80 and 3 vol.% Tween80 were mixed to obtain the volumetric ratio of 1:1.
"The testing of diesel engine was conducted to determine the exhaust emissions (O2, CO2, CO, HC and NOx), specific fuel consumption (SFC), and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) with a swirl chamber and indirect injection diesel engine (IDI) under 0%, 25%, 50% and 75% engine load at 2300 rpm engine speed."
"The results showed that HC emission gas of using D42B50W2S3T3 blend was decreased by 5.39% and 2.00%, when compared with diesel and biodiesel, respectively."
"Moreover, Nox was decreased by 19.26% for diesel and 8.89% for biodiesel."
"In testing of diesel engine performance at 75%, 1.88 kg/hr of specific fuel consumptions (SFC) and 0.32 kg/kw.hr brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) obtained from the emulsion fuel, which was slightly higher than 2.42% and less than 2.98% as compared to diesel and biodiesel, respectively."
"In conclusions, the emulsion blend can reduced the NOx and HC emissions in a IDI diesel engine with 75% engine load at 2300 rpm."
"Therefore, D42B50W2S3T3 blend can reduced the HC and NOx emissions, in which this alternative fuel usable in a diesel engine without modifications."
