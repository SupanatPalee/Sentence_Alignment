"Although a wide range of aerospace materials is used, such as magnesium, titanium, steel, and fiber-reinforced polymer composite, Aluminium is an important structural material for aircraft and aerospace and remains popular in the present day because aluminium has many good properties such as ease of machining and shaping, low cost, high corrosion resistance, non-combustibility, light weight and high strength and recyclability."
This research paper starts with describing a classification of aluminium and its alloys into two categories: Wrought aluminium alloy and Casting aluminium alloy.
These two alloy groups are also divided into two subgroups.
Age heat-treatable aluminium alloy subgroup is strengthened by precipitation hardening process and Non heat- treatable alloy subgroup is strengthened by cold working (forming).
Age heat-treatable wrought alloy is mainly employed to product the airframe components because of its higher strength and higher toughness than those of the casting alloy group and the cold forming alloy group.
"Example of this alloy group is AA2xxx, AA6xxx, AA7xxx, AA8xxx, etc."
It includes to describe method characteristicsof precipitation strengthening which is an significant mechanism for strengthening the airframe sections and various temper designations.
