"This research study investigated the efficiency of a wet scrubber dust catcher that was able to be implemented in a community rice mill at Gardmek Village, Chompoo sub-district, Mueang district, Lampang province, to reduce airborne dust pollutants which were causing problems in the community, by studying the bulk density of dust from the community rice mill."
The result of rice dust density while running the system was approximately 1.12 mg/m3.
The standard value of dust density at the release point was specified as being no more than 0.10 mg/m3.
"In addition, other parameters were investigated to evaluate the theoretical efficiency of the collecting system."
"These were the velocity in the air duct, the flow rate of water appropriate to the flow rate of air, and the design of the light clay ceramic berl saddle with its dust catching efficiency located inside the wet air scrubber."
The scrubber design program was employed to create the data that was used in the scrubber design.
The result of the designing and building of the wet air scrubber dust catcher suitable for community rice mills found the cross-section area of the barrel to be 0.25 m2 and 1.5m in length.
The ceramic berl saddle found that was produced at 900 degrees Celsius had the best water and dust absorbance.
"When the designed air scrubber was installed and tested at the community rice mill, it was found that the amount of flying dust in the mill was reduced by 91% with water at 3 bar of pressure."
