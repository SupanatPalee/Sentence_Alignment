The objective of this research was to design and construct a gummy jelly drop prototype machine and examine its efficiency and quality compared with the manual process.
The assumption was that the prototype machine could reduce the working time of gummy jelly drop fabrication and increase production capacity.
The gummy jelly drop prototype machine is semi-automatic involving work by a user.
The machine consists of two parts: the machine structure and the ingredients frame.
The results showed that the use of the prototype machine could increase working efficiency by 83.33 percent compared with the manual process.
The standard working time was reduced from 16.08 min to 2.69 min.
The physical properties of the gummy jelly drops from the drop prototype machine and the manual process had a diameter and thickness with a significant difference (p≤0.05).
A specialist carried out an estimation of the prototype machine’s IOC.
"The overall quality of the machine was estimated at 0.82, the level that the research was set to achieve."
"Therefore, it is considered that the gummy jelly drop prototype machine can be used practically with a reduced working time."
