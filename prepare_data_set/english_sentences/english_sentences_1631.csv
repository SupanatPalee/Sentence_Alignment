"The purpose of the research was study to evaluate the simultaneous quantitation of four anthraquinone compounds, namely anthraquinone, alizarin, chrysophanol and emodin in 8 plants include root of Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.), Cassia fistula L. (pulp, seeds, peel and leaves), Cassia siamea leaves, Rosell seeds and Basil seeds by High Performance Liquid Chromatography."
"For component separation, the method utilized a C18 column (150×4.6 mm, 3.5-Micron) in reverse phase with isocratic elution using a mobile phase of 0.1% v/v Ortho-phosphoric : Acetonitrile (50 : 50 v/v)."
Wavelength of 254 nm was used for detection.
"The results of determine anthraquinone compounds, anthraquinone, alizarin and emodin were found in the Noni roots."
Chrysophanol was found in only pulp and seeds of Cassia fistula L. sample.
Alizarin and emodin were found in Basil seeds sample and anthraquinone was found in Cassia siamea Britt leaves.
The validation of the chromatographic method was performed that the linear calibration curves were obtained over the concentration range of 0.5-10.0 µg/mL for anthraquinone alizarin chrysophanol and emodin with good correlation coefficients (R2 > 0.9995).
The accuracy of the method was reported as the recovery in the range of 75.1-106.8%.
"However, this method gave satisfactory precision in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD) value in the range 0.2–2.0% (n=7)."
