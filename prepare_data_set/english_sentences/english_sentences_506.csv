The objective of this research is to design and develop a plate cutting machine for community enterprises.
The machine was designed to adjust the speed at a maximum of 800 rpm and its was able to cut fresh bamboo shoots with a plate thickness of about 3 mm.
"Moreover, the test in differences of the cutting time of 3 types of bamboo shoots in the community involving in Kimju bamboo shoots, rough giant bamboo and sweet rough giant bamboo shoots."
"The results of the timing performance test of the plate-type fresh bamboo shoot slicer showed that Kimju bamboo shoots average time was 36.73 seconds per kilogram,Â  rough giant bamboo had an average time of 32.74 seconds per kilogram, and sweet rough giant bamboo shoots had an average time of 27.48 seconds per kilogram."
The average time of the bamboo shoot slicer is 32.32 seconds per kilogram.
Data were analyzed by One-way ANOVA with significance level of 0.05.
It was concluded that bamboo shoot type had no effect on cutting time and the mean time of slicing of all 3 types of bamboo shoots is representative of the plate slicer.
The efficiency was compared with the traditional strand and plate pickled bamboo shoot slicer.
"It was shown that the average time was 25.31 minutes per 10 kilogram at the blade speed of 800 rpm, which was an average time of 151.8 seconds per kilogram."
"Nevertheless, the time the representative of the designed disc shredder was 32.32 seconds per kilogram."
"It was found that it took 119.48 seconds less time, representing a 78.71 percent improvement in performance."
