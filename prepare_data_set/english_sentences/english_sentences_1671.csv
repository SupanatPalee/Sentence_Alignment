Encapsulation of anthocyanin extract from broken homnil (HN) colored rice by maltodextrin dextrose equivalent 20 (MD20) with inulin (IN called “MD20:IN”) or with pectin (PEC called “MD20:PEC”) with the ratio of 1:3 the double drum drying techniques was used for investigation.
"Encapsules MD20:IN showed higher encapsulation efficiency, anthocyanin content, solubility (95.36±2.55 g/100 g) and provide the shorter time for wettability than MD20:PEC."
"Morphology of particle measured by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) had the broad peak with 2q of 18.4–19.96°, representing an amorphous and irregular shape as confirmed by 200x scanning electron microscope (SEM)."
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR spectra) showed the conjugated between core (bioactive compounds) and carrier agents.
"Both encapsules had comparable thermal stability as determined at 80°C, 90°C and 100°C."
The results confirmed that encapsulation could protect biofunctional compounds in the extract.
