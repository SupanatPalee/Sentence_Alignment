This paper proposes improvement of transmission characteristic for tunable optical drop filter.
The results of the transmission characteristic analysis to output port ( ) found that the side mode appears is rather which this causes more crash of the signal detection to the receiver bring the optical amplifier mix with optical ring resonator of tunable optical drop filter due to the optical amplifier affect to the finesse transfiguration of optical ring resonator and adjust the optical gain of the optical amplifier found that a side mode decreased.
The optical gain is 5 and will be decreased of side mode is 0.
The result of improvement the transmission characteristic of the optical filter can be applied to DWDM passive optical network and reduce error in the receiver.
