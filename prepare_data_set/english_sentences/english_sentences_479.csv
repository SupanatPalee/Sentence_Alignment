"The objective of this research was to study on drying kinetics, specific energy consumption, qualities were color and water activity, antioxidants and antioxidant activities, as well as mathematical modeling of drying of black kaempferia."
The moisture content of black kaempferia was reduced from 121.58% to 7.47-12.18% d.b.
"by combined vacuum and microwave technique at three levels of drying pressure, i.e., atmospheric pressure, absolute pressure of 20 and 5 kPa using a microwave power of 800 Watts."
The study found that the shortest drying time of 150 minutes using an absolute pressure of 5 kPa.
"Anyway, drying at 20 kPa absolute pressure had the lowest specific energy consumption of 50.73 MJ/kgwater evap."
and the lowest total color difference is 8.21.
"However, all experimental conditions had water activity within the standard, not more than 0.6, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were decreased compared to fresh black kaempferia."
Drying of black kaempferia at absolute pressure of 5 kPa had the highest total phenolic compounds at 2.73 mg GAE/g f.w.
"and the highest antioxidant activity of 1.00 mg AAE/g f.w., which were higher than sun drying."
Midilli's empirical mathematical model is suitable to predict drying kinetics for drying black kaempferia.
It has the highest coefficient of determination (R2) 0.99936 and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) 0.00737.
