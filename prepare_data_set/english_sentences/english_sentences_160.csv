"Traffic surveys are the foundation for analysis, design, planning, assessment and management of traffic and transportation."
"The Moving Observer Method (MOM) is widely used for macroscopic traffic flow variable survey which is easy to apply and, cost and time efficient."
"This study applied artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for traffic surveys, using YOLOv7 architecture for vehicle detection, StrongSORT architecture for vehicle tracking, Canny Edge and Hough Transform for lane line detection to classify vehicle type and movement for estimating traffic flow variables based on MOM."
"The experiment was implemented with datasets from 5intercity routes in Thailand, single carriageway road with 2 lanes, length 2 to 5 km."
"The results indicate that the performance of vehicle type and movement classification (number of opposing vehicles, vehicles overtaking the test car, vehicles passed by the test car) was F1-score of 93.25, 94.79, and 64.62% respectively."
"In summary, the performance of traffic flow variable estimation based on MOM (flow rate, mean speed and density) compared to the actual data was mean absolute percentage error of 2.36, 0.73 and 2.86% respectively and highest absolute percentage error was 7.88, 5.80 and 7.65% respectively."
