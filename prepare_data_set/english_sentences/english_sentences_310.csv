"This study aims to isolate fungi from Lam Khlong Ngu National Park, Kanchanaburi, Thailand and optimize laccase production."
"The result showed that three fungal isolates could produce laccase including KKU-LKNG-04,KKU-LKNG-07andKKU-LKNG-16."
"Based on ITS rRNA gene analysis, these fungi (KKU-LKNG-04,KKU-LKNG-07 andKKU-LKNG-16) were similar toGanoderma lucidum,  Megasporoporia sp."
"andRigidopolus vinctus, respectively."
"The potential fungus isolate which gave the highest lacaase production under solid-state fermentation using sugarcane bagasse as a substate, wasMegasporoporia sp."
KKU-LKNG-07.Determination of factors on fungal cultivation related to laccase production was appliedone factor at a time method and optimized by response surface methodology using Box-Behnken approach.
"The results from one factor at a time method revealed thatconcentration of nitrogen source, pH and temperature obviously influenced fungal cultivation."
"For optimization of laccase production,the highest laccase production (5.58 U/mL)from fungi Megasporoporia sp."
"KKU-LKNG-07was predicted under conditions including concentration of nitrogen source, pH and temperature of 4.17 g/L, 8.45 and 29.55 °C, respectively."
"Later, the laccase production experiment under the optimized conditions was performed."
Megasporoporia sp.
KKU-LKNG-07 producedlaccase of 5.48 U/mL which was closed to the predicted value.These results indicated the potential of laccase production and optimization which would be useful for further commercial application.
