"This research aims to study the mechanical properties of the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing by thermal annealing method, and to provide a recommendation for the selection of suitable industrial 3D printing thermal conditions by the multi-level factorial experiments."
"In this research, the parameters in the study were annealing temperature, annealing hold time, and type of heating."
"The annealing temperature was set in the range of 60 to 70 °C, the annealing hold time was 30 to 50 minutes, and the type of heating was during annealing and post annealing."
"In this investigation, polylactic acid was used to print the specimens with the FDM 3D printer with a heat annealing machine."
"As for the results, the tensile strength was measured with a universal testing machine using Minitab software for statistical analysis and processing."
"From the experiments, it was found that the most suitable 3D printing thermal conditions were the annealing temperature of 60°C, the annealing hold time of 30 minutes, and during annealing."
The ultimate tensile strength was 52.41 MPa.
