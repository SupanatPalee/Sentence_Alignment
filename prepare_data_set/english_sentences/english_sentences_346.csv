sentences
This paper focuses on studying an application of the heuristics algorithms.
They have developed for parallel machines scheduling in various industries.
"Three case studies including dishwashing, raw rubber sheet, and sea freight industries have conducted to results comparison."
"The algorithm used in the production scheduling for all case studies are 6 algorithms, consisting of 4 algorithms derived from the existing algorithms, namely SPT-BL, SPT- UL, EDD-BL, EDD-UL and 2 new algorithms, LBL and LUL."
"From experimental computing, it founds that  the algorithm suitable for the dishwashing industry and raw rubber sheet industry is the LUL algorithm."
"The algorithm that is suitable for the sea freight industry is the algorithms namely SPT-UL, EDD-UL and LUL Keywords: Heuristics, Parallel machines, Production scheduling"
