This research is a study of the differential of volume estimation results between Surpac and AutoCAD Civil 3D (C3D).
"The survey data from 7 stockpiles were transformed to CSV (Comma Separated Values) file extension, it is the input data for volume estimation of both C3D and Surpac."
The estimation results from both software were analyzed and compared with the estimation result of Average End Area method.
The result show the average percentage of absolute differential between Surpac and Average End Area with AutoCAD C3D and Average End Area are 3.2% and 3.5% respectively.
While the standard deviation of both case are 2.9.
The comparing of estimation results between Surpac and AutoCAD C3D show the average percentage of absolute differential is around 5.3.
