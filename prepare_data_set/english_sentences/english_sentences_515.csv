The purpose of this research was to study the cooling water flow rate affecting the performance of the solar photovoltaic-thermal hybrid system.
A multicrystalline solar cell of Trinasolar model TSM-345PE15H was used to test the power generation in combination with a cooling water system installed under the solar panel.
"The cooling system consists of 6 copper pipes, 3/8” diameter with a length of 1,815 mm It is connected with 2 manifolds, 7/8” diameter with a length of 799 mm."
"The results found that, as the cooling water flow rate between 25 and 250 LPH, the solar cell efficiency tends to increase as the flow rate increases."
The solar panel has a maximum efficiency of 12.55% when cooled water has a flow rate of 100 LPH and the system can increase the hot water temperature from 29.10 °C to 51.29 °C.
"Moreover, amount of heat produced was 3894.41 kJ and the amount of electricity produced was 11.37 kWh."
