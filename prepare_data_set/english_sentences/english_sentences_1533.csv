This research is aimed to study the deformation under the uniaxial tensile test of a metal wire with a mobile phone running on the iOS system and recording rate of 60 frames per second.
"The recorded images were analyzed for positions, changing with time up to theirs breaking points, using the Tracker program 6."
The relationship of force and deformed length were then evaluated on the Microsoft Excel Sheets.
The results showed that the kits could be employed as an instruction medium for learning about material deformation.
"The analyzed results, at constant the deformation rate of 50 cm/min, showed an increasing of tensile strength and strain at break depending on the initial wire length of 5–20 cm."
The tensile strength increased from 2.5 GPa to 5.1 GPa while the strain a break increased from 1.15 to 2.56.
"At a constant wire length of 5 cm, it was found at the elastic range of the wire didn’t depend on deformation rate and it was about 20 percent."
"These elastic ranges rapidly increased to 35 percent when their initial length increased from 10 to 50 cm, whereas the Young’s modulus of material decreased from 1.4 GPa to 0.8 GPa."
The resulting images and their analyzed data are suitable for using as learning media on the elastic properties of the materials for middle and high school levels.
