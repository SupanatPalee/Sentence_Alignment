Finite element method was therefore used for analyze structures by computer aided engineering analysis before production of structures.
This article presented a method for determining the boundary conditions for rollover angle analysis using computer aided engineering.
It was analyzed under the static load assumptions and the linear elastic material properties.
The results of the computer aided engineering analyzes were compared with the experimental results of a simple structure.
The results showed that the maximum error was 63.63% when analyzing with boundary condition type 1 and the result showed that the maximum error was only 2.42% when adjusting the method for setting the boundary condition to type 2.
The researchers hope that this study will be beneficial to automotive users in terms of structural safety and for automotive manufacturers in terms of design and manufacture.
