The purpose of this research was to study the effects of salinity stress on seed germination and antioxidant activities of germinated cereal grains.
"Ten cereal grains such as RD 43 rice, berry rice, black rice, black glutinous rice, jasmine rice, mung bean, black bean, red beans, corn, and black sesame seed were evaluated."
"The grains were germinated under 5 levels of salinity stress at concentrations of 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% by soaked for 12 hours and germinated for 48 hours."
The germinated grains were randomly sampled every 12 hours to analyzed germination percentage and root length.
The results showed that 0.5% salinity stress condition was the best induction of germination of all 10 grains.
"Then, the effect of 0.5% salinity stress on antioxidant activity was compared with the control."
The 10 cereal grains were germinated under 0.5% salinity stress condition by soaked for 12 hours and germinated for 48 hours.
The germinated grains were randomly sampled every 12 hours to analyzed antioxidant activities.
"The results showed that total phenolic compound content, ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activities by DPPH and FRAP methods of all grains germinated under salinity stress condition had higher than the grains germinated under normal condition."
"Therefore, seed soaking and germinating under salinity stress before cooking is another way can increase the nutritional value of whole grains."
