sentences
The electric furnace temperature control system is one of the real-world second-order systems plus time delay (SOSPD) widely used as the process control in industries.
It is normally operated under the PID feedback control loop.
"The PIDA controller, however, performed better response than the PID controller for higher order plant."
"In this paper, an optimal PIDA controller design for the electric furnace temperature control system is presented."
"Regarding to modern optimization context, the Bat-inspired Algorithm (BA) which is one of the most efficient population-based metaheuristic optimization techniques is applied to search for the appropriate PIDAâ€™s parameters."
The proposed BA-based PIDA design framework is considered as the constrained optimization problem.
System responses obtained by the PIDA controller designed by the BA will be compared with those obtained by the PIDA controller also designed by the BA.
"As results, it was found that the PIDA can provides the very satisfactory tracking and regulating responses of the electric furnace temperature control system superior to the PIDA, significantly."
