The Lower Chao Phraya River is area that is affected by changing of sea level resulting in two directions of flow and sediment transports depending on the upstream water levels and sea water levels.
The study of sediment behavior in this area is important for solving problem about water transportation and water management.
"Hydraulics data were collected by Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, echo sounder and suspended sediment equipment in the Lower Chao Phraya River between November 2015 and May 2016."
It is found that the diameter of suspended sediment is 0.027 mm.
Sediment settling velocity is 21.31 mm/s.
Spring tide and neap tide are the most effect to behavior of suspended sediment.
Sediment load equations are presented by three variable linear equation q = (9x10-5)Q – 0.0002D in spring tide and  q = (4x10-5)Q + 0.0032D in neap tide.
R2 are equal 0.6484 and 0.6007 respectively.
