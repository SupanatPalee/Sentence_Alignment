This article presents a smart power meter for monitoring photovoltaic performance using internet of things technology (IoT).
This research was designed to work on the Blynk application for real time monitoring on mobile phones.
"In addition, administrators could be alerted via LINE application in the event when the panel voltage was lower than the control value or the panel's current was higher than the panel's limit."
"The performance monitoring of PV panel included voltage (V), current (A), power (W), power consumption (Wh), and the PV panel's electricity generation percentage (%)."
The efficiency assessment results of the device showed that the average voltage measurement error was 0.45% and the average current error was 1.19%.
The operation study results of the device installed with the photovoltaic power generation system indicated that the performance could be tracked.
"In addition, the cumulative power data could be used as power forecasting data to plan for changes in load."
It could also help caregivers plan for inspections and maintenance at the right spot faster while reducing the risk of accidents.
