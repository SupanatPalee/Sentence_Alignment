The obtained solutions are shown by hyperbolic and trigonometric functions, which can be transformed into kink waves and periodic waves in their physical nature.","In this paper, we apply the Riccati-Bernoulli sub-ODE method to analyze the (1+1)-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg-Higgs equation and the (3+1)-dimensional modified KdV-Zakharov equation, both of which are ion wave equations. These solutions are shown by hyperbolic and trigonometric functions, which are able to directly transform their physical nature into kinks and periodic waves."
