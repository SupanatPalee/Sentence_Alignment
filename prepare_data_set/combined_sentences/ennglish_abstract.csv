This paper presents the performance improvement of harmonic detection using the Synchronous Detection with Fourier analysis (SDF) method to calculate the reference current of a shunt active power filter (SAPF) for single-phase power systems.
The Positive Sequence Voltage Detector (PSVD) is applied to the SDF method to improve the accuracy of the reference current calculation in the case of a distorted voltage source.
Where the objective is to enhance the effectiveness of harmonic elimination for single-phase power systems.
"For the harmonic detection testing, the hardware-in-the-loop simulation technique of the Simulink/MATLAB program and the TMS320C2000TM Experimenter Kit DSP board are used to simulate the harmonic elimination system."
The simulation is divided into two cases of voltage sources: a pure sinusoidal waveform and a distorted waveform caused by harmonics.
The simulation results show that harmonic detection using SDF in cooperation with the PSVD method (SDF+PSVD) can reduce the percentage of the total harmonic distortion (%THD) value of the source current to 3.07% for the case of a pure sinusoidal voltage waveform and to 2.00% for the case of a distorted voltage waveform.
These %THD values are lower when compared with the SDF method and synchronous detection (SD).
"From the result, it confirms that the SDF cooperated with the PSVD method can provide better performance for harmonic detection."
"Therefore, the shunt active power filter can effectively eliminate current harmonics in the single-phase power system."
"Moreover, %THD of the source current after compensation is also satisfied under the IEEE std."

Silk suture was a type of suture material commonly used by dentists to close wounds in the oral cavity.
It provides strong tensile strength and was consistent with wound healing by maintaining suture integrity to promote wound healing for at least 3-5 days.
"However, non-resorbable sutures made of silk were known to accumulate food debris and increase the risk of infection, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or immune deficiencies."
"There has been recent development in coating silk sutures with antimicrobial agents to reduce the risk of infection, but no studies had been conducted using silk sutures coated with such agents."
This study aimed to evaluate the physical and biological properties of non-absorbable and multifilament braid silk sutures that have been coated with levofloxacin.
"The physical properties of strength, amount of pore with SEM and BET analysis, and the presence of levofloxacin solution were assessed, as were the biological properties of drug release profile."
All groups were compared between dry and wet conditions of the coated silk sutures and non-coated silk sutures.
"The results showed that the levofloxacin-coated silk sutures had no significant difference tensile strength between non-coated silk sutures, and the release of levofloxacin was sustained over a period of 7 days."
BET analysis showed that the wet group had less porosity and wider pore diameter than the other groups.
"Therefore, the use of levofloxacin-coated silk sutures was provided comparable suture strength to non-coated silk sutures while reducing the risk of infection."

The purpose of this research is to study the effect of obstacles across channels to determine if they increase flooding of the stream.
The HEC-RAS model was used to simulate water flow and levels with and without obstructions across streams.
The level of water and the height of the stream bank were analyzed to determine the distance of flooding along the stream in both cases.
The results showed that the effect on the water level in front of the obstacles such as a weir or a culvert is different.
The water level in front of the culvert is lower than the water level in front of the weir at low flow.
"However, when the stream flow exceeds the flow capacity of the culvert, the water level in front of the culvert will be higher due limited by the cross-section of the culvert receiving the water flow."
The flood distances and water levels along the stream under high flow show that the flood distances decrease to 580.6 meters from 953.4 meters along the channel when no obstacles restrict the flow.
The existence of obstructions in the channel causes the water level to rise higher than usual thus causing the flood distances to increase along the upstream side of the obstruction while flooding does not occur downstream of the obstruction.
This research shows that culverts are prone to causing greater flooding than weirs during heavy rainfall events.

Water loss (WL) in water distribution systems (WDS) is a main problem of waterworks in Thailand.
A WDS can be divided into a trunk main network (TMN) and a water distribution network.
Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) estimates WL in its TMN about 60-120 million m3/year.
"Thus, this research presents a monitoring system using the water balance method for 4 routes of the MWA Prachachuen Branch TMN with fairly complete permanent measured flow data from the Remote Monitoring System."

"This research investigates unconfined compressive strength development in recycled pavement base material improved by fly ash and calcium carbide residue geopolymer at curing times of 7, 14, 28, 60, and 90 days."
"This research studied the effect of liquid alkaline activator content comprised of sodium silicate (NS) and sodium hydroxide (NH) with NH concentration of 8 molars, the RCR:CCR:FA ratios, and the NS:NH ratios."
The test result showed that the maximum dry unit weight of the RCR-CCR-FA geopolymer sample decreased as the FA increased due to the lower specific gravity of FA.
The 7-day unconfined compressive strength increased as FA content increased due to the increased amount of Si and Al.
"Sample with optimum liquid alkaline content, RCR:CCR:FA ratio of 40:10:50 and NS:NH ratio of 2 gave the maximum unconfined compressive strength of 9.88 MPa."
"Based on the Department of Highways (DOH) standard, All ingredients passed the DOH standard."
"Furthermore, the proposed equation is beneficial for estimating the unconfined compressive strength of RCR-CCR-FA geopolymer when 28-day unconfined compressive strength was known."
Cellular lightweight concrete is mortar mixed with preserved air bubbles or foam liquid distributed in concrete instead of coarse aggregate in order to reduce the concrete unit weight.
The properties of cellular lightweight concrete vary with unit weights.
Concrete with great amount of bubbles given high porous and light weight provides low thermal conductivity.
Cellular lightweight concrete with unit weights of 1600 and 1800 kilograms per cubic meter using water to cement ratio of 0.45 and 0.55 and sand to cement ratio of 2:1 and 3:1 were designed and produced for the study of thermal conductivity and the remained compressive strength after heating at various temperatures.

876-2547).
"The study results revealed that the suitable condition for bamboo sheet hot extrusion from bamboo scraps was at the hot compress temperature of 190 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes, due to its highest average bending, highest average modulus of bending, highest average bending strain, highest average tensile strength and modulus of tensile."
The comparison result to Thai industrial standard (TIS.
"876-2547) found they passed 3 standards of average thickness swelling, tensile strength and modulus of tensile and did not pass 2 standards of bending and modulus of bending."

This paper presents the harmonic detection using PQF in combination with the fundamental positive sequence voltage detector (Fundamental Positive Sequence Voltage Detector : FPSVD) for co-phase AC railway systems.
"The proposed method is used to calculate the reference current for harmonic compensation of the shunt active power filter (Shunt Active Power Filter : SAPF), both in cases where the voltage source of the railway system is a pure sinusoidal waveform and in cases where the voltage source of the railway system is distorted due to harmonics."
Harmonic detection tests in co-phase AC railway systems apply hardware in the loop simulation techniques using Simulink/MATLAB software with the TMS320C2000TM Experimenter Kit DSP board.
The simulation results for the case where the voltage source of the railway systems is a pure sinusoidal waveform found that harmonic detection using the PQF method can calculate the reference current more accurately and flexibly than the conventional PQ method.
"As a result, the percentage of total harmonic distortion (%THD) after compensation at the three-phase power system, which is the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) is less than 0.42%."
In cases where the voltage supply of the railway systems is distorted.
"It was found that harmonic detection by the PQF method combined with the FPSVD method has better performance than using only the PQF method, resulting in the shunt active power filter effectively removing harmonics in co-phase AC railway systems, and %THD after compensation at the PCC point is less than 0.86%."
"Moreover, the %THD after compensation of the source current decreases within the framework of IEEE Standard 519-2014."
This paper presents the application of the TCS3200 color sensor module with Arduino ESP32 microcontroller to estimate the dirtiness of solar panels caused by dust.
The surfaces of solar panels with different amounts of dust accumulation have different reflectance values.
"Therefore, this reflectance measurement instrument was designed using the TCS3200 color sensor module to measure the reflectivity in RGB values and convert it to gray scale values."
The gray scale was then used to correlate with the amount of dust accumulated on the solar panels by experiments by simulating the dust situation on the solar panels at various levels ranging from 0 – 25 g/m2 on a 50 W polycrystalline solar panels.
The results showed that the gray scale value measured by the TCS3200 color sensor module correlated with the amount of dust on the solar panel.
When tested by measuring the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage of the tested solar panel.
It was found that the value decreased with the amount of dust on the solar panel inversely related to the gray scale.
The maximum power output from the solar panel is 43.56 W when the solar panel is clean and free of dust.
"When the dust accumulation on a solar panel reaches 5 g or more, it initiates a decline in the power output generated by the panel."
The power output reached its minimum value at 38.23 W when the dust accumulation on the solar panel reached 25 g/m2.
"The decrease in power is caused by the amount of sunlight reaching the solar panel is reduced because it is blocked by dust particles, causing the solar panel to lose its efficiency in receiving sunlight."
The soil ratio of solar panels decreased inversely with the amount of dust.
It was found that the soil ratio of the solar panels decreased inversely with the amount of dust.
it can be inferred that the TCS3200 color sensor module is capable of measuring the difference in reflectivity caused by dust on the surface of the solar panel.
This ability enables the module to estimate the level of dirtiness or dust accumulation on the solar panel surface.
"Therefore, the TCS3200 color sensor module can be used as a tool to assess the cleanliness of the solar panel surface based on its reflectivity readings."
Precast concrete component production is an important part of off-site construction technology.
The main construction activities are substantially moved to the factory so that the production process and the environment can be managed to achieve higher efficiency.
The design of the production process needs to consider all constraints related to the size and shape of the factory site.
This research was conducted to determine the location of the factory on the land of a participating private company.
"The layout and the production process were designed in accordance with the area, which resulted in a factory that was divided into 4 lanes, 9 rows per lane, including the design of new machines to help achieve semi-automatic production with lower investment than the commercialized technology from abroad."
"As a result, there are 2 production methods, namely Multi-lane Circulatory Pallet (MLCP), and Single-line Circulatory Pallet (SLCP), then the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed."
"Finally, it is an estimation of the investment and cost-effectiveness analysis of the establishment of this new factory."
"In five years, the factory is expected to yield a net present value (NPV) of 3.9 million baht, with an attractive internal rate of return (IRR) at 8.4%, and a payback period (PB) of 4 years and 2 months."
The results of the new factory design indicate that the precast concrete production business can be initiated at a lower investment cost and suitable for the potential of medium-sized construction companies.
"The most common problem in the assembly of the read/write heads in hard disk drives is the damage of the piezoelectric actuator, which is rigid but brittle and prone to fracture."
The objective of this research is to predict the behavior under impact conditions of the head stack assembly (HSA) model with the piezoelectric actuator installed.
The authors found that the piezoelectric actuator is damaged during installation to the support device.
"The finite element model of the read/write head is made using the properties of stainless steel and piezoelectric (PZT) materials, and the force on the HSA is converted to impact velocities in the range of 8.4 - 9.2 m/s."
The model is then analyzed using explicit dynamics in the condition that the HSA collides with a rigid support.
"The HSA can move freely in vertical direction (Z axis) but cannot move in the plane (X, Y axes)."
"After the analysis, the deformation and Von Mises stress results are investigated."
The FEA results show reasonable deflection behavior of the read/write head and show that the maximum Von Mises stress in the piezoelectric actuator is due to impact.
"The maximum stress occurs before the read/write head reaches its maximum deflection, suggesting that explicit dynamics analysis is preferred to static analysis."
"The impact velocity is a factor that influences the stress results, as can be observed from the maximum Von Mises stress in the piezoelectric actuator, which ranges from 135.74 to 154.61 MPa."
The stress values increase with higher impact velocities.
"However, the analysis predicts that the piezoelectric actuator is damaged at all impact velocities, which does not align with the actual test results."
"Additionally, the predicted deformation of the piezoelectric actuator is much greater than the deformation observed in actual tests."
The authors believe that these analysis results can be improved by using more accurate properties and failure model parameters of the piezoelectric material in the construction of the finite element model.
The material information can be obtained from appropriate mechanical tests.
The results from this study can be used as a guideline for improving the assembly process to reduce the number of piezoelectric actuator damage.
The purpose of this research was to reduce process waste and to compare the performance before and after the improvement.

"This research was performed to compare the mechanical and physical properties of polylactic acid plastic strands with fluorescent agent additives with recycled polypropylene plastic strands mixed with polylactid acid, and fluorescent additives for 3D molding process."
"Three proportions of fluorescent agent additives were used: 0.3%, 0.5% and 1%."
"The results showed that the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, percentage of elongation, hardness, flow index, of recycled polypropylene strands mixed with polylactid acid and 0.3% fluorescence agent ratio were optimal, resulting in favorable plastic filaments for 3D printer molding."
"The addition of large quantities of fluorescent agent resulted in polymer viscosity, which decreased the tensile strength and the flow index of the product."

The compound preparation process was made possible a with Twin Screw Extruder and the composite and sample works were created by a hot-pressing process.
Results of this study indicated that the types of recycled-polypropylene affected the mechanical and physical properties significantly.
"The size of rice husk ash affected the hardness value, impact resistance value, and melting index."
"Increasing the proportion of rice husk ash from 1 to 7 PHR significantly affected the tensile strength, hardness value, impact resistance value, and melting index."
The possible trend of this study revealed that a higher proportion of rice husk ash addition resulted in higher hardness and Young’s modulus values.
"However, it reduced the impact resistance, the stretch percentage, and melting index values."

This research study purposed to select appropriate material for making base-cutter blades in sugarcane harvester using technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and rank order centroid (ROC) method.
"The eight criterions affecting material decision were weighted importance using ROC method, which were 1) modulus of elasticity 2) machinability 3) hardness 4) toughness 5) harden ability 6) wear resistance 7) non-deforming properties 8) cost, respectively."
After that materials in the steel group which have suitable properties for making base-cutter blades in sugarcane harvester were considered for alternative decisions.
"It was found that there were 5 types namely spring steel (AISI 5160), alloy steel (AISI 4140), medium carbon steel (AISI1045), water-hardening tool steel (AISI W1) and high-carbon high-chrome air-hardening steel (AISI D2)."
"Finally, the closeness coefficient was computed to be used to rank alternative decisions with the TOPSIS method."

"On the other hand, the other steel was arranged in descending order based on their closeness coefficient value."
"In this research, two macroscopic-mathematical models namely, the Smeed model and the Koren & Borsos model, are applied to predict road deaths per 100,000 population (D/P) and to evaluate the general performances of the implementation of various road safety measures in Thailand compared to the national road safety targets."
"While the Smeed model is adopted to illustrate that the D/N values will decrease, as the vehicle occupancy rates increase, the Koren & Borsos model is also used to model the relationship between the D/P values and the vehicle occupancy rates as an inverted U-shaped curve."
"It was found that at the national level of Thailand, the D/P values tended to decrease as the vehicle ownership rates increased."
"For the Koren & Borsos model, this findings indicated that at the current situation, Thailand has already passed the turning point (the maximum D/P value)."
"Importantly, Thailand sill cannot achieve the national road safety targets."
"At the provincial level of Thailand, the relationship between the D/P values and the vehicle occupancy rates is as an inverted U-shaped curve."
"However, the reliability of such relationship is relatively low."
The trend of the D/P changes of each province is uniquely distinct over time (years).
These circumstances can cause problems and obstacles in setting the road safety targets of each province to be consistent with and lead to achieve the national road safety targets of Thailand in the future.

"A variational formulation of a beam system has been developed based on principle of virtual work, which is written in term of intrinsic coordinate."
The geometric relation of deformed infinitesimal length of the beam is derived by considering the elastica theory.
The non-linear finite element method incorporated with the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure is used to solve the numerical solution.
"In addition, the set of nonlinear first-order differential equations obtained from the force and moment equilibrium, moment-curvature relationship, and nonlinear geometric relations of the beam segment, which is categorized as two-point boundary value problem is numerically solved by using the shooting method."
Then the numerical results from the finite element method are independently verified by those results from the shooting method.
"The results also show that the beam self-weight and the compressive force at the beam tip cause the support movement, which induce large deflection."

Gloves are one of the most widely used personal protective equipment in industrial and agricultural work fields.
"However, use of gloves may affect an ability of the hand."
The purpose of this research was to study the effects of glove use on grip strengths at different working postures.
"The study was conducted with a sample group of 40 university students (20 males and 20 females) aged 18-22 years, average height 166.74 (±9.44) cm, average weight 63.52 (±19.34) kg."
"The experiments were first tested with bare hands against the use of three different types of cotton yarn knitted gloves: 1) non-patterned gloves, 2) rubber-dotted gloves, and 3) fully rubber-coated gloves."
"Grip strength was measured using a hand dynamometer in 3 postures: straight arm (180 degrees), elbow flexion (90 degrees) and shoulder flexion (45 degrees)."
Dominant and non-dominant hands are measured.
The study found that the average grip strength of the bare hands of both hands was higher than when using gloves.
"In testing the dominant hand, it was found that the highest hand grip strength was the straight arm (29.3 kg), followed by the shoulder flexion (27.9 kg) and the elbow flexion (27 kg)."
The dominant hand test in all positions was higher than the non-dominant hand (11.5-12.5%).
"In addition, straight arm extension (180 degrees) was found to have the highest hand grip strength in both bare-handed and gloved use."
"It is found that, compared with bare hands, different types of gloves were associated with different reduction in the grip strength: 20.6-22.2% for fully-coated gloves and 8.4-9.9% for rubber-dotted gloves."
"Analyzing with the paired t-test, significant differences of resultant grip strengths were confirmed across the experimented postures and types of gloves."
"However, in male samples, there was no significant statistical evidence between the grip strength of bare hands and rubber-dotted gloved hands when the samples performed a particular posture with the elbow bent at 90°."
"Results from the experiments urge operators to be selective on glove use, leading to not only being able to use their hands effectively, but also to avoid any accidents that may be caused by hand fatigue."

Printing on packages as per customer need in the case study revealed the problems at the stage of prototype inspection before production.
"The error was caused by the printing department, of which the printing plate system took too many materials and color production ingredients as not necessary."
This resulted in high production cost.
"Also, there was neither data recording nor color adjustment to be in accordance with the company standard."
"Thus, this research aimed to improve color formations in industrial printing by mixture design."
"The factors to be studied were 2 new color formulations, i.e., Formulation 1: Pink, which included 9 ingredients; and Formulation 2: Purple, which included 3 ingredients."
The experiment of each particular formulation was implemented as the amounts of ingredients for 3 formulations.
"Then, the results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, with the significance level of 0.05."
The ingredients of the 3 formulations were considered.
It was found that the reduction of ingredients did not affect tone change.
"More specifically, the results of improvement revealed that the total amount of Formulation 1: Pink was 69.60 kg, which could reduce to 48.60 kg; with the cost reducing to 7,346 baht (42.30%)."
"The total amount of Formulation 2: Purple was 29 kg, which could reduce to 17 kg; with the cost reducing to 3,498 (39.13%)."
"Besides, the values obtained from these improved color formulations could be recorded as the standard values of the company for package printing in the future."

"The evaluation score is 2, which means the process is acceptable."
"Moreover, the economic assessment section found that the production cost per unit was 0.046 THB, and the payback period was approximately 0.55 years."
This paper presents a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of single-phase grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system using non-iterative method.
The proposed method considers the change in PV voltage.
The reference maximum power of PV panel was calculated by the open-circuit voltage (Voc).
"Therefore, the power response using the proposed method is faster than that from the iterative MPPT methods."
The effectiveness of the proposed non-iterative method was confirmed by computer simulation and hardware in the loop simulation using a TMS320F28335 microcontroller board with MATLAB/Simulink.
The results show that the proposed MPPT method can reach the maximum power point in a shorter time compared with the traditional iterative methods.

Artificial intelligent techniques are very popular in engineering works.
"This paper presents three techniques as follows: genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and adaptive tabu search to identify the accurate parameters in the mathematical model of AC-DC power system feeding the parallel controlled buck converters."
The controlled power converters behave as the constant power loads in which they can significantly degrade the system stability.
"Hence, the stability analysis is necessary to predict the unstable point of the system."
"However, it is not only the behaviors of the controlled power converters but the parameters of the system also affect the system stability."
Some parameters cannot be measured by the instrument directly.
"Therefore, the artificial intelligent techniques will be used to search the parameter values that correctly represent the system response."
"After these parameters are achieved, the dynamic model with accurate parameters will be used for the stability analysis by the eigenvalue theorem via the mathematical model."
The stability analysis verification will be confirmed by the simulation and experimental results.

This research paper aims to design and build a chick counting machine instead of manual labor that may cause counting errors due to fatigue.
"The author used a Jetson Nano Developer Kit 4GB board and installed the Ubuntu operating system, Python, Cuda, YOLO, anddisplayed it on a 7-inch LCD."
The authors conducted experiments on real chicks at belt speeds of 0.2 m/s and 0.5 m/s.
"By counting when one chick was released onto the conveyor, the increased belt speed had no effect on the count."
"When 2-3 units are released, the higher the belt speed, the greater the counting error."
"When 5 chicks are released on the conveyor, the higher the speed, the less accurate the counting."
"In addition, the chicks move on the belt, which makes the counting result more error prone."
"In particular, the release of chicks at once and the speed of the belt are increased."
The chick counting machine is only a prototype if it is actually used on the farm.
It will have to be further developed using a board with a larger processor and higher performance.
"The structural design against impact loading is generally used impact factor to increase capacity of structural member, which may not be very accurate."
"This is because the impact force, reaction force, and especially inertia force are occurred in structural member under impact load, which are not considered in static problem."
"In this research, the impact behavior of 9 simple beams, including reinforced concrete beams (RC) and rectangular concrete-filled steel tube beams (CFST) designed to have same load capacities and hollow steel beams (HS), under dropped steel hammer 160 kg from 700 mm height were observed."
The results revealed that the most of impact force in early stage was absorbed by inertia force.
The CFST beams which have elastic stiffness less than RC beams significantly showed the well impact loading performance.
They can reduce the impact forced more than 7 times compared to RC beams with same load capacities and also reduced the reaction force from colliding events.
The RC beams reached the brittle failure and HS beams occurred the local buckling at the impact point.
"Nevertheless, CFST beams did not demonstrate any damage."
These results illustrate that CFST beams are appropriate to resist impact load.

"Thus, this study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of zigzag line markings installed ahead of the zebra crossing."
"According to data collection process, the crosswalk on a major route at the Prince of Songkla University was chosen."
The results revealed that the average speeds and the 85th percentile speeds of passenger cars decreased significantly after seven days of the installation.
"Afterwards, the speeds marginally closed to the speeds before the installation."
"As a result, the estimated fatality probability of pedestrians indicated that the zigzag line markings could reduce the probability by 1-6 %."
"In addition, the markings also increased the drivers’ perception and caution before the crosswalk."
It can be concluded that zigzag markings could reduce the fatality probability of pedestrians.
This paper presents an analysis of perception of passengers on COVID-19 countermeasures taking the Blue and Purple Line as case a study.
The samples were passengers of the MRT Blue Line and MRT Purple Line traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and second order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicates that passengers’ perception consists of five factors: Awareness (highest factor loading of 0.84), Confidence, Health, App, and Distancing (with factor loadings of 0.81, 0.81, 0.69 and 0.40 respectively)."
"It was found that although passengers felt uncomfortable with respect to the social distancing measures such as alternate seat blocking and reduced capacity, they were aware of the consequence of the measures, so they felt confident to travel safely."
"It was also found that passengers are highly aware of measures related to public health such as temperature screening, strict enforcement of mask wearing and hand sanitization."
The findings are applicable to operation of other public transport modes such as bus as well as post-covid operation.
"The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency of activated sludge cells in free cell (FC), attached cell (AC) and entrapped cell (EC) modes to treat of synthetic wastewater with tetracycline contamination."
Synthetic wastewater has contained COD of 270.33±6.64 mg/L and tetracycline of 9.25±0.08 mg/L.
"The batch experiment was tested under aerobic condition for 72 h. The results showed that all experiments removed COD rapidly within 24 h. (36.95 68.97 and 83.77% for FC, AC, and EC, respectively) and COD was stable thereafter."
"The tetracycline removal was 10.36, 30.20 and 36.33% (from the test of FC, AC, and EC, respectively), because the treatment process is a biological treatment which relies on microorganisms, causing microorganisms to take time to remove (it takes time to acclimate, and it grows by decomposing organic matter)."
"When comparing the efficiency of the activated sludge cells in FC, AC and EC models, the author found that the highest removal efficiency of COD and tetracycline was the activated sludge cells in the EC model."
"Cell entrapment was helped to prevent microbial inhibition from tetracycline, and also, the entrapped material absorbs organic matter, thereby, increasing the efficiency of organic removal."
"As for the trace of pH and Suspended Solid (SS), the author found that the pH was in the range of 7.02-8.31, which was the range of microorganisms in the wastewater could grow, and all experimental sets had no different results."
The SS level increased with all trial set.
The free cell experimental set had the highest of SS.
The higher SS level was due to the effect of free microorganisms which suspended in the system.
"When the samples were collected and analyzed for the SS level, the amount of SS level was higher."
"But in the AC and EC, there was an increase in SS caused by the surface of the entrapped material which peeling off, and microorganisms were growing outside the entrapped material."
The results of this study suggested that the entrapped cell has the potential to be applied in the future to treat tetracycline contaminated wastewater.

The ratio of rubber seeds charcoal powder to tapioca flour of 10:1 was also used.
"The specimens at the age of 7 days were tested for compressive strength, bulk density, moisture content, calorific value, duration of burning until extinguishing, produce sparks and smoke."
"The test results showed that the increasing of coconut shells charcoal powder resulted in the increasing of compressive strength, bulk density, calorific value, and duration of burning until extinguishing while decreasing of moisture content values."
"All of these specimens do not produce sparks, do not smoke, and passed the standard requirement as per Thai Industrial Standard 238/2547 for charcoal briquettes and thus can be used as commercial charcoal briquettes."

"The objective of this research was to improve the efficiency of the bottle sorting process, a case study of a dairy company in Songkhla province."
This research started from a study current state of the company case study.
"Then, the root cause analysis was analyzed using Why-why analysis principles."
The ECRS principle was applied as the main guideline for improving work with the design of the bottle sorting device.
The results of the study and analysis of the sorting 400 bottles of 180-milliliter milk bottles revealed that before the improvement which was the old way of sorting bottles.
It took an average time of 552.00 seconds.
"After improvement by re-sorting bottles using the prototype device, it was found that the average time was 352.86 seconds."
"The average time for sorting bottles was reduced by 199.14 seconds, or 36.08 percent and it can also reduce the workflow by two steps, or a 33.33 percent reduction."

This research aims to study the parametric analysis on the behaviour of dam constructed by the composite contiguous pile wall and deep mixing column wall as a new alternative dam structure.
"The selected case study is the dam in Lake Legend Chaengwatthana project, Bangkok, Thailand."
"This dam was constructed in a deep rainwater pond without providing the water removal, which could save on both time and cost construction."
"In the parametric studies, there were the embedment depth of contiguous pile wall, the water level in a lake, the stiffness of soil-cement column wall and the depth of improvement by deep mixing method which were investigated on the stability of dam in term of the lateral displacement of dam and the bending moment on the contiguous pile wall by the finite element method using PLAXIS 2D."
"The studies can be concluded as: the increase of the embedment depth of contiguous pile wall, the stiffness of soil-cement column wall and the depth of improvement by deep mixing method reduce the lateral displacement of dam significantly."
The increase in the different water level between both sides of dam can increase the lateral displacement but reduce the stability of dam significantly.
The bending moment on the contiguous pile wall reduces with the decrease of the embedment depth and the different water level.
Whereas the bending moment increase with the decrease of the soil-cement stiffness and the improvement depth.
"For all these study cases, it was confirmed that the maximum bending moment of outer wall was always higher than that of inner wall."
The outcome of this research will be fundamental to develop a design guideline of soil-cement column wall by deep mixing method in soft Bangkok clay and other similar soft clay deposits especially in Southeast Asian countries.
"At present, research studies on the increasing demand ampliﬁcation, or the bullwhip effect (BW), under a dual-sourcing supply chain network are limited."
"In addition, no existing research clearly states whether and how order lead times influence the bullwhip effect under the dual-sourcing supply chain environment."
This research thus investigates the impact of lead times on bullwhip effect in dual-supplier supply chain.
The retailer's orders are divided between two suppliers.
Both cases of equal and unequal lead times at the suppliers-retailer links are examined.
"In this research, a simulation approach is used to create the incoming demand process for the retailer according to first order autoregressive (AR(1)) model."
"Also, all members use the order-up-to inventory policy and the moving average forecasting technique."
The findings indicate that an increase in lead times is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in the bullwhip effect.
The local water management has suffered from the shortage of accurate areal rainfall data collection in use of automatic rain gauge with partial pixel of 200 cm2 caused by the lack of the device installation in the area and the extreme complication of natural phenomenon involving precipitation.
"In response to that, the adoption of remote sensing technology in weather radar has been introduced to rainfall measurement for the past 50 years."
"When interacting with raindrop particles, the weather radar can detect radar reflectivity which varies depending on rainfall drop size distribution."
This reflectivity subsequently becomes applicable as a support method to the conventional rainfall estimation after translated into rainfall intensity (R (mm/cm)) by using relationship Z-R (Z=aRb).
"This study had begun and concluded the data collecting process during August 25, 2018 to August 31, 2020 and accumulated 230 rainfall event data, including hourly rainfall data from 174 automatic rain gauges and radar reflectivity from Takhli radar operating under its measuring radius of 240 km, in analysis of altered Z-R relationship correspondingly to periodical rainfall drop size distributions to compare with the result by the use of Climatological Z-R relationship,  Z=200R1.6 and Z=300R1.4."
"The result shows the improvements in accuracy of radar measurements of rainfall by incorporating the altered Z-R relationship correspondingly to periodical rainfall drop size distribution, raising up to [9.05%,10.68%,12.42%], [18.96%,22.50,26.39%], [18.59%,21.60%,25.78%] and [512.14%,580.58,621.36%] when considering from RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and BIAS respectively, in comparison to that of Climatological Z-R relationship,  Z=200R1.6 and Z=300R1.4."
The purpose of this research was to investigate the factors influencing and affecting the surface roughness of aluminum grade 2024 turning with carbide cutting tool using brand Plansee Tizit type DCGT 070204FN-27 H10T.
"The main factors were Speed, Feed, and Depth of Cut."

"It was found from the experiment that the factors affecting the surface roughness were Speed, Feed, and Depth of Cut with a tendency for reduction of roughness value at lower Feed and Depth of Cut and at greater Speed."
The turning condition was to be determined by mean of the equation Ra = 0.651 – 0.000295 Speed + 0.485 Depth + 2.77 Feed.
The experiment was to confirm the result of a comparison between the equation and the percent accuracy with the margin of error.
"The result from the experiment of mean absolute percentage error (MEPE) of the equation of surface roughness was 3.15%, which was less than the margin of error and was acceptable."
"There is a large demand to export rubberwood in the furniture industries of Thailand, which has major rubberwood resources in its southern areas."
"This research studied two different methods for drying rubberwood and specifically drying kinetics, modeling, effective moisture diffusivity, and wood drying rate in a microwave oven."
"In the experiments, the same size of a piece of rubberwood as typically used in a factory, and two different approaches were applied to dry the pieces of rubberwood to reduce their moisture content."
"Drying control was regulated by microwave power, which adjusted the microwave power from high to low within 90 min and 150 min."

"Thus, the accessory developed in this research work can make medical professionals’ work more convenient and more secure."
"This research aims to propose an effective inventory Management policy for home decor businesses, with a focus on a specific study case."
"The business being studied sold home decor items at its physical stores, each of which came with its own selling and marketing techniques."
"As marble items were unique in their own way, coupled with the unpredictable needs, they were usually displayed at the stores in large numbers to avoid the loss of sales opportunity - which in turn resulted in overstocking."
"In this study, a new method was proposed to improve the company’s inventory policy, making it more systemic and better organized."
Results from the proposed inventory policy were estimated using the order-up-to level (OUL) model.
"The order intervals were set at two and four weeks, and given the optimal order quantity (Q*), 99.90% cycle service level, and the fixed lead time of one week - the analysis was made with factors such as limitations and selling methods of each of the stores, as well as the unpredictable needs for the home decor items, all being taken into account."
The proposed inventory policy was tested using a simulation model to make comparisons with the actual demand for such items between January and April 2021.
Findings show that the average inventory could be cut down by no less than 50% and the cycle service level was still able to reach 99.90% as expected.

Microalgae cultivation for being a biological feedstock of high-value products has long depended on culture conditions and various important factors.
The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios on the growth and fatty acid accumulation of a freshwater microalga Chlorococcum humicola (TISTR 8551).
The microalgae having an initial density of 2.00x106 cell mL-1 was cultivated in a bubble column photobioreactor with a working volume of 10 L under batch condition for 14 days.
"The growth broth employed was modified BG-11 medium with the initial molar ratios of nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) of 50:1 (GM-100%N), 5:1 (GM-10%N), and 2.5:1 (GM-5%N)."
It was found that the growth and fatty acid of the microalgae had different responses to a variation of the initial nitrogen concentration of the growth medium.
The microalgae cultivated in the GM-100%N provided maximum biomass productivity of 0.77 ± 0.14 g L-1 d-1 and a specific growth rate () of 0.139 d-1.
"The figure of  obtained was higher than those cultivated in the GM-10%N and GM-5%N with 69.51 and 98.57%, respectively, because the GM-100%N had enough concentrations of nitrogen for the microalgae to synthesize protein and chlorophyll."
"Then, these compounds were used by the microalgae for photosynthesis and cell division resulted in lower activities of fatty acid synthesis and accumulation than those cultivated in the growth medium having relatively lower initial N:P molar ratios."
"On the other hand, the microalgae cultivated in the GM-5%N gave the highest cumulative fatty acid content of 30.6 ± 1.2 %DCW."
This was because the GM-5%N provided a higher degree of nitrogen starvation.
"Therefore, the microalgae reduced protein and chlorophyll synthesis activities and turned to increase fatty acid synthesis and accumulation in cells to prevent cell damage and degradation from light exposure during the cultivation period."

"The maximum effect was 3112 Hz, which occurred in the Coil sway mode shape and the minimum effect was 32 Hz, which occurred in the Arm bending mode shape."
"Adjusting the position constraining of the HDD actuator arm was the one method to increase or decrease the natural frequencies hence the natural frequencies were outside the frequency band of the external force, resulting in the HDD actuator arm to be under normal vibration."
"Traffic jam, at a signalized intersection, is a common problem in urban areas that emergency vehicles such as ambulances are usually stuck in a queue."
"Thus, emergency medical transportation may be impeded leading to unnecessary damage or death."
This research aims to develop an intelligent traffic signal system that prioritizes emergency vehicles.
"The main focus is developing a method for measuring the time-varying queue length at a signalized intersection, which is an integral part of the system's operation."
"In the past, most of research analyzed the queue lengths by using traffic detectors, but they have rarely been installed and used in Thailand In this paper, we present a new approach to estimate the queue length that does not need a traffic detector; instead, it utilized color-coded traffic data from Google Maps to predict the queue length based on three different methods: which are Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and The Mean method."
"The study found that the length of the colored bars displayed on Google Maps can, to some extent, provide a good approximation of the actual queue length trend, and are more correlated with two methods especially in rush hours with heavy traffic."
"The Random Forest, among three methods, yields the best performance in predicting the queue length when compared to the other two methods."
"The effect of the Earth’s curvature, various geographical features and the variability in each rainfall event results in different rainfall drop size distributions depending on timing."
"Therefore, using climatological Z-R relationship to estimate radar rainfall can lead to bias in its estimate seeing from the unequal amount of air rainfall and ground rainfall."
"This study uses rainfall data collected by 2 sources, first is Omkoi rainfall radar that is set at 1.5° elevation angle measuring under the radar’s umbrella that covers 240 kilometers radius, and the other is 122 automatic rain gauge networks."
The data had been recorded since January 2015 until October 2017.
"The collection of 126 selected rainfall events, 100 calibration events (80%) and 26 verification events (20%) had been taken into account to find hourly bias adjustment that is able to reduce the bias in grid cells in size 1x1 kilometer (1 km2) of Omkoi radar rainfall estimation."
"This research applies the Inverse Distance Weighting method that requires previous rainfall accumulating of various duration: 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours from both sources that locate no further than 20 kilometers from the targeted grid."
"The result of this study indicates that the rainfall estimate process with the application of the equation Z=42R1.6 and the Inverse Distance Weighting method together with the previous rainfall accumulating of 1 hour from both sources, is the most suitable method for Omkoi radar rainfall estimate."
"This method gives the closest RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MSE (Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to 0, and closest R (Correlation coefficient)  to 1 between estimation of radar rainfall after adjusted and rainfall at automatic rain gauge networks in both calibration and verification events."
"Comparing to initial radar rainfall estimating with the sole use of the equation Z=42R1.6, this method can increase accuracy in RMSE evaluation to 11.42% (4.39%)."
"In the meantime, other assessments those are MSE, MAE and R, also show that this method can increase the accuracy to 21.83% (8.60%), 3.82% (4.46%) and 22.95% (18.03%) in calibration and verification events, in order."
"Generally, the maintenance of protective relays in substation often faces difficult issues because the number of devices is huge."
"Besides, the protective relays have different models, brands and technologies, service lifetime, used environments and applications to customer loads, etc."
The protective relays are also different from other power devices in that they only operate when a fault occurs in the power system.
"Therefore, the protective relays are less risk of failures, and their deteriorations are not obvious."
"However, the impacts caused by relays' failures will lead to serious damages to other high-cost equipment and dangers to operators."
"As a result, they cause power outages or disturbances in a wide area."
This paper proposes a method for assessing the risk of protective relays in the substation.
The study consists of two main parts: (1) the condition assessment of the protective relays related to the probability of failure and (2) the criticality assessment of the relays to show the importance of impacts when relays fail to operate.
The maintenance data from the diagnostic test and the historical operation data are used for assessing the conditions of protective relays.
"The substation tier, relay scheme, bus configuration, and load importance are used for assessing the criticality of protective relays."
The results are proposed with the case study of 10 micro-processer protective relays installed at Pathum Thani 2 and Pathum Thani 3 substations of the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).
Each protective relay can be replaced with different risk phases.
"Moreover, obtaining results can be utilized to prioritize maintenance and select the appropriate protective relay maintenance activities for receiving economic worthiness."

This research investigates the vibration of a split-type air conditioner compressor during on and off modes in order to identify the relationship between the mechanical vibration and the supplied electrical current.
"Under the controlled room temperature of 25°C, experiments were performed at refrigerant pressure levels of 80, 60 and 40 psi with three scenarios including (1) one bolt used to fix the compressor with the base being removed, (2) all bolts being tightened and (3) evaporator filter being loaded with dust."
"The results showed for the first scenario that at 80 psi refrigerant pressure the vibration amplitude occurred at 0.037-0.047 mV/g with the compressor electrical current of 3.63-3.68 Amp, whereas the amplitudes occurred at 0.020-0.026 mV/g with the current of 3.44-3.47 Amp for 60 psi and 0.020-0.023 mV/g with 3.17-3.20 Amp for 40 psi."
"When all bolts were firmly fixed, applying refrigerant pressure of 80 psi led to the amplitude at 0.032-0.034 mV/g in conjunction with 3.62-3.66 Amp compressor current, while the amplitudes were at 0.017-0.020 mV/g and 0.016-0.018 mV/g with the electrical currents of 3.62-3.66 Amp and 3.16-3.18 Amp for 60 and 40 psi, respectively."
The final scenario of dusty filter revealed that the vibration amplitude was 0.018393 mV/g corresponding to the compressor current of 3.88 Amp for 80 psi pressure.
"When the refrigerant pressure was reduced to 60 psi, the vibration amplitude decreased to 0.015673 mV/g with 3.84 Amp of compressor current."
Additional decrease of the pressure to 40 psi cause further reduction of the amplitude to 0.010987 mV/g with the electrical current reducing to 3.65 Amp.

"However, removal of DBAN under the UV-LED process was found to have a rate constant (6.4 × 10-3 min-1) and removal efficiency higher than UV-LED/Cl2 (5.6 × 10-3 min-1) and Cl2 (4.5 × 10-3 min-1)."
One-way ANOVA statistical results showed that HANs removal by UV-LED/Cl2 UV-LED and Cl2 processes were significantly different (p < 0.05).
"However, no statistically different for HANs removals among three processes at pH 8 (p > 0.05)."
The results of this work suggested that UV-LED/Cl2 can be an alternative method to remove HANs in drinking water.
"This study aims to remove triclocarban (TCC), which is a bactericidal agent contaminating in water, using wasted material from wood vinegar production."
The materials were biochars produced from bamboo and eucalyptus.
This study emphasized on the use of the biochars as sorbents and cell immobilization materials.
Microorganism applied in this study was Pseudomonas fluorescens MC46.
"The experiment included 1) biochar characterization, 2) TCC removal efficiency and kinetics, 3) microbial growth on biochars, and 4) biochar and cell-immobilized biochar morphology."
The results showed that a major element of both biochars was carbon (45-52% by weight) with specific surface areas of 25-27 m2/g.
"Based on morphological characterization, both biochars were porous materials."
"For the cell-immobilized biochar, microorganisms spread over the material surface."
The biochars and cell-immobilized biochars could remove TCC with similar efficiencies (72-78%) while the free cells degraded 42% of TCC.
"However, in the long term, cell-immobilized biochars likely provide better overall treatment efficiency because there is toxic contaminant degradation by cell and adsorption by porous materials."
The results indicated that biochars from the wasted materials were good sorbents and microbes can be immobilized onto these materials for the biodegradation process.
"In addition, the biochars could prevent the microbial cells from diminishing TCC exposure."
The results of this study can be further used as a guideline for cell-immobilized biochar utilization for the removal of contaminants using combined adsorption and biodegradation processes.
The objective of this study was to explore the potential growth inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani (R. solani) using caffeine from Arabica coffee pulp with respect to different concentrations of caffeine.
"R. solani commonly causes seed rot, damping-off, sheath blight, and leaf blight."
"In this study, R. solani was cultured in the laboratory scale using Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates in the presence of caffeine concentrations of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/L for 10 days at room temperature."
"The results showed that caffeine from Arabica coffee pulp gave significant difference in the growth inhibition rate of R. solani, as compared to the control condition (P<0.01)."
"Caffeine from Arabica coffee pulp at the concentrations of 20 and 40 mg/L gave the average growth inhibition rates of R. solani of 15.3±4.2% and 58.8±3.5%, respectively."
"Besides, the concentrations of 60 and 80 mg/L resulted in the average growth inhibition rate of R. solani of 100.0±0.0% for both conditions, as no growth of R. solani could be found on the PDA plates."
These results could be explained by the allelopathic potential of caffeine on inhibiting the growth of plant pathogenic fungi.
"This study provided a development of efficient method for growth inhibition of R. solani in which focused on the use of natural substances, as the caffeine content in Arabica coffee pulp was used."
This Arabica coffee pulp was considered as an agricultural waste.

"This research aims to create the improvement of Khao-Pong production process development in Ban Nong Loeng Community Enterprise Group, Kan Noi, Kham Khuean Kaeo district, Yasothon province, in order to reduce the waste."
It was found that the Khao-Pong demand rate was so high that it could not be produced and sold to customers within the designated time.
"After primarily analyzing the problem by using value stream mapping (VSM), it was shown that the production lead time was too long, 2,066.03 minutes, in which there included the processing and waiting time at 1,187.79 and 878.24 minutes respectively."
The production lead time in this research started from being delivered the materials to transforming it into Khao-Pong products.
"It was found that the waiting time came from three activities: 1) rice molding, 2) pressing the rice flatly, and 3) peeling the rice before drying."
"Here, the check sheet was used to collect the waiting data of all activities."
"It is found that the waiting time to produce, or work in process (WIP), is 97.22% of the waiting time which is obviously useless and too long."
"So, it must be eliminated."
"To fulfill the objective, the Why – Why Analysis was applied to analyze the causes and apply ECRS tools to increase the production efficiency in order to produce rice sheet more quickly, and to set the job standards."
"The job standards are 1) the jig – a tool for pressing the rice, 2) setting the windproof tools."
"From the improvement of cycle time in pressing the rice flatly and peeling the rice before drying, the result showed that production’s cycle time decreased for 13.75%, the waiting time decreased for 81.00% but the production lead time decreased for 42.34%."
"At the same time, the finished products increased from 987 to 1,400 sheets per day."
"This helped increase the revenue from 284,256 to 403,200 baht per year, resulting in raising an income and developing the economy within the sustainable community enterprise."
The purpose of this quasi-experimental research was to determine the percentage of weight loss in volatile suspended solids during the process of total suspended solids analysis by microwave.
The electrical energy was also compared between standard method and microwave with decreased costs.
"The result showed that the total suspended solids analyzed by 800-watt microwave at High level with the duration periods of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 minutes provided the weight loss of total suspended solids at 0.9, 1.4, 3.3, 4.1, and 4.5 percent, respectively."
"The electric energy consumption for total suspended solids analyzed by microwave was 0.005 - 0.026 THB/sample, while the cost of the standard method was 0.050 THB/sample."
"For total suspended solids analyzed per day, the microwave method was equal to the standard method when applied for 2 microwaves to 1 oven, thus decreasing the cost of oven purchase about 50,000 – 60,000 THB."
The aim of this research was to study the improvement of nitrogen titanium dioxide catalysts by doping with iron (Fe-N-TiO2) on degradation performance of reactive red 120 dye under visible light.
Fe-N-TiO2 and N-TiO2 catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method without calcination process.
"In this work, the catalysts were studied to compare the dye removal efficiency."
"The catalysts were titanium dioxide with doping 1 percent by weight of iron (1.0%Fe-N-TiO2), without iron doping catalyst (N-TiO2), and commercial catalyst (P25)."
"The physical and chemical properties of catalysts such as crystal structure, crystallite size, morphology, specific surface area, oxidation state of elements, energy band-gap and magnetism value were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), N2-adsorption-desorption, X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRs) and Versalab (VSM), respectively."
The results found that N-TiO2 and P25 catalysts were mainly obvious the anatase crystalline phase with small amount of rutile phase.
"On the other hand, 1.0%Fe-N-TiO2 catalyst was found the decreasing of anatase crystallinity and disappearing of rutile phase."
"The doping with iron, the smaller anatase crystallite size was observed as about 10-11 nm."
The morphology of catalysts prepared by the hydrothermal technique showed nearly spherical shape and nano-size.
"However, the catalyst with iron doping was obvious in smaller size than that without iron."
The specific surface area of the catalysts calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation was found that catalyst doping with iron has the highest specific surface area as about 115 m2/g.
The oxidation state of iron was indicated in the Fe3+ electronic state.
The iron doping (1.0%Fe-N-TiO2 catalyst) can reduce the energy band-gap from 2.94 eV (N-TiO2) to 2.70 eV.
"Moreover, the magnetism of 1.0%-Fe-N-TiO2 catalyst was about 0.011 emu/gram."
The result of the reactive red 120 dye removal in both adsorption and photocatalytic reaction under visible light were found that the efficiency of the 1.0%-Fe-N-TiO2 catalyst was 99% degradation and gave the highest performance as compared with the N-TiO2 and P25 catalysts.
It can be concluded that the nitrogen titanium dioxide catalyst modified by iron doping can actually be used to decompose pollutants under visible light.
This study investigates the feasibility of using polylactic acid and coffee grounds to create environmentally friendly composites.
"The study applied the design of a statistical experiment to study two factors, namely coffee grounds mixing volume (10, 20 and 30% by weight) and the amount of the reaction substance (0, 1, 3 and 5 parts per hundred)."
The compositions were mixed by twin screw extruder and formed into specimen for testing the properties by the hot-pressing process.
"The results of the property testing and statistical analysis show that increasing coffee grounds increased the melting index, hardness, modulus of elasticity, and the percent elongation of the composite."
The addition of a coupling agent led to an increase in tensile strength and modulus of elasticity.
"However, the regression analysis showed that the influence of both factors affected the properties, in which the relationship of factors can be modeled using quadratic polynomial model rather than simple linear model."
Morphological analysis shows that coffee grounds should not be mixed more than 20% because it affects the stability and homogeneity of the composite.
"The results of the research show that 10% coffee grounds should be mixed with 5 parts per hundred, resulting in the properties of composites that are suitable for creating a product with unique color and aroma of coffee grounds."
Manganese contamination causes problem for water consumption.
This research aims to investigate manganese removal using entrapped microbial cells.
The influence of an activated carbon content and a microbial cell density in entrapment material on manganese removal was focused.
Streptomyces violarus strain SBP1 (a biological manganese-oxidizing bacterium) and barium alginate supplemented with powdered activated carbon (entrapment material) were chosen.
"The experiment divided into 3 parts, including 1) manganese removal by barium alginate supplemented with powdered activated carbon (1, 5, and 10%, w/v), 2) manganese removal by the powdered activated carbon-barium alginate-entrapped cells at different microbial cell densities (100, 200, and 500 mg/L), and 3) entrapped cell micro-structural investigation using scanning electron microscope."
The result showed that microbial cell density and powdered activated carbon supplement obviously affected manganese removal efficiency.
Barium alginate with 5% powdered activated carbon supplement provided the highest manganese removal (42%).
The powdered activated carbon-barium alginate-entrapped cells at microbial cell density of 200 mg/L gave the best manganese removal (51%).
Micro-structural observation showed that powdered activated carbon and microbial cells distributed over the material.
These results could be used as a fundamental information for entrapped cell application for water treatment system in the future.

Rural Road No.
SK2031 passing Wat Khow Kloy School was selected as a case study.
"The speeds of passenger cars passing before and after each traffic calming device location were collected, analyzed, and compared."
The results showed that the overhang sign could not significantly reduce vehicle speeds.
"Conversely, the typical OSB and the OSB with red strips could reduce the vehicle speeds significantly."
"However, the intersection may have some effects on the results."
A design and mathematical modeling of a hydraulic pressure converter with a conventional hydraulic transformer working with a high-speed on-off valve is presented in this paper.
The goal of the research is to increase the load pressure range by utilizing the motor to pump displacement ratio within the hydraulic transformer and system flow rate controlling of an on/off valve with the duty ratio.
A throttle valve is also used to simulate the load pressure.
"For mathematical modeling, pressure drop across an on/off valve is considered."
"While, a pump and motor can be analyzed with ideal equations."
"Therefore, duty ratio, motor to pump displacement ratio and pressure drop effect the equivalent load pressure and the fluctuation magnitude."
"As a result from a steady state analysis, it has been found that wider equivalent load pressure range can be achieved by increasing the motor to pump displacement ratio."
"In addition, the magnitude of fluctuation is highest at the duty ratio of 0.6."
"For effect of the pressure drop, it reduces the load pressure linearly with the duty ratio."
"Nevertheless, it has been found from the transient analysis that increasing the motor to pump displacement ratio by increasing the motor displacement results in reducing settling time but fluctuation is increased."
"On the other hand, by reducing the pump displacement, the settling time is increased but fluctuation is decreased."
This paper aims to study performance of turbidity removal of the clarification water in water treatment plant by sludge blanket clarifier.

This study has investigated the potential in the near future to use ethanol in a compression ignition engine or diesel engine without any engine modification.
The selected engines tested are comprised of two types.
The first one applies an in-line mechanical pump nozzle type which has been used in the past until now in the old vehicle and extendedly applied in the agricultural engines.
"The second one uses the high-pressure electronic common rail injection system, which is broadly used in modern diesel vehicles nowadays and in the future."
Ethanol was used as the blend in diesel fuel with a concentration of 5 (E5) and 10 % (E10) by volume.
"To prevent a phase separation, biodiesel 3 (B3), 7 (B7), and 10 % (B10) by volume were added to diesel before adding the ethanol as an emulsifier for the blended fuels."
"Therefore, three ethanol-diesel-biodiesel blended fuels including B3E5, B7E5, and B10E10 were used in this study."
"The responses of the engines to the fuel were monitored in terms of torque, thermal efficiency, and exhaust gas emissions which were compared when using diesel B7, the standard diesel fuel in Thailand."
The results found that ethanol-blended fuels could be used in both engines which respond to the test fuels in the same trend for almost all indicators.
The types of injection systems partially contributed to the effect of ethanol on the engine operation.
"The use of ethanol-blended fuels, engine torque decreases for both engine types."
"However, a break thermal efficiency increases in the engine using mechanical pump system but there is no particular trend for the electronic injection system."
Oxide of nitrogen and total hydrocarbon increase when using ethanol-diesel-biodiesel blends.
"The more the ethanol is blended, the higher the amount of nitrogen and total hydrocarbon are emitted from the engine with the mechanical type injection system."
"However, the engine using electronic injection control is not dependent on the ethanol concentration solely."

This research aimed to investigate apply a gas tungsten arc welding with non-filler metal for producing a dissimilar material tube joint between AISI304 and AISI316 stainless steel using a welding current range Z90-165A).
Tube joints were produced various welding current conditions.
"Their properties, tensile strength and metallurgical characteristics, were then investigated."
The results showed that an optimized welding current that produced maximum tensile strength of 486 MPa and elongation of 18% was 135 A.
A width and a penetration of the weld metal that were increased because of an increase of the welding current affected to produce a sound joint and showed higher tensile strength.
Increasing welding current that affected to increase a weld bead concave and a root convex of the joint resulted to decrease the joint tensile strength because of a decrease in cross section area for supporting a test load of the joint.
A fracture of the tensile test specimen that showed maximum tensile strength was located at the weld metal that was nearly an interface between the weld metal and AISI316L base metal.
This result was caused by a dendrite structure characteristic in the AISI316L base metal interface side was coarser than that of the AISI304 base metal interface side.

Two effective factors in the DOE method were the hole size of stencil block factor varying at 0.25 and 0.30 millimeters and the board size height factor varying at 0.50 and 1.0 millimeters.
The result of this research showed that the appropriate parameters to set up the machine were the hole size of stencil block factor of 0.25 millimeters and the board size height of 0.50 millimeters.
"After the experiment, it showed that the lead bridging wastes were eliminated from 1.85 percent to zero resulting in the reduction of the total amount of waste to be 0.35 percent due to a decrease in waste in other production processes."
"Therefore, after improving the factors of production, the total amount of waste was in line with the target set."
This research aims to apply the maximum flow model in order to demonstrate production route and find the maximum flow of the brake pad manufacturing.
This case study company produces and distributes brake pads for automobile.
The company has more than 400 models of brake pads.
There are 20 main-production processes and 46 machines to produce brake pads.
"However, every product does not undergo all production stage."
"As a result, there are 14 formats of production procedure which are difficult to set production plan and analyze the production capacity of system."
"Thus, the machines did not work efficiently and the cost of production capacity plan might be more expensive in the future."
"In this case study, the research process was started by collecting data from the company."
"Then, ABC analysis was employed to choose product sampling."
"Moreover, Labeling algorithm and Generic augmenting path algorithm were adopted to find the max flow."
The machines in each production process from source to sink were described by arcs and nodes respectively.
"The results showed that the company could produce 25,880 of brake pads per day."
"When this number was compared with the production capacity in each day, it was found that the maximum flow model could help produce brake pads up to 1,375 pieces per day (5.6%)."
"Furthermore, the company could also know the machine's utilization of each process."
The maximum flow model could help the company analyze the capacity of production process accurately.
"Thus, the company could use this model to help plan production process, production capacity and machine maintenance in order to increase efficiency in each production process."
This project studied the effect of nickel loading on Ni-Al2O3 catalyst with preparation by co-precipitation method.
"The amount of NiO was 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%wt."
"The catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, TEM and SEM-EDS techniques."
"Then, the synthesized catalysts were activated with H2 superior to test with deoxygenation of oleic acid in a batch reactor."
The reaction was operated at a temperature of 310°C for 4 h using H2 pressure of 40 bar and analyzed the product with gas chromatograph.
The characterization results revealed that the presence of crystal phase of β-Ni(OH)2 and Al(OH)3 was obtained for non-activation Ni-Al2O3 catalyst synthesized by co-precipitation.
The synthesized catalysts were mesoporous structures.
"Moreover, only 19%wt of Ni metal was detected on the alumina surface."
The catalytic activities via deoxygenation were determined using Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst activated with H2.
The 80Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst provided 68% conversion of oleic acid with maximum C17 yield via decarbonylation and decarboxylation.
54% of C14-C18 yield as a green diesel was obtained at reaction time of 240 min.
"This was due to the 80Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst was the highest Ni on the catalyst surface area, high NiO dispersion and high average pore size."
"While, 0Ni-Al2O3(R) catalyst could not be active for deoxygenation, this can be seen from the lowest hydrocarbon yield less than 1%."

The objective of this research is to develop a potentially statistical model using the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) for the climate seasonal prediction of rainfall in Thailand.
The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate system and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the tropical Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean are taken as the main factors of precipitation.
The Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (EOFs) is firstly performed into the calculation.
The first few leading principal component has been analyzed via the spatiotemporal patterns of positive SST anomaly dominated the Indian Ocean and the central Pacific Ocean together with the tendency of increasing over past sixty-four years of data set.
The CCA is applied to find the correlation between SST over the tropical Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean during August1951-2015 and precipitation in Thailand during the September-October-November (SON) of the first few leading EOFs.

The skills scores have been improved to the moderate skills (about 0.3-0.4) in the northern Thailand and some regions of southern Thailand with zero-month lead (SON) and declined from OND to JFM.
The CCA generally outperforms persistence at zero-lead times.
The ENSO phenomenon and SST anomaly are found to play some role in the precipitation variability in Thailand regions: Warming ENSO episodes tend to suppress northern summer rainfall and enhance southern summer rainfall in Thailand and cooling ENSO episodes tend to enhance northern summer rainfall and suppress southern summer rainfall in Thailand.
This work aims to study the influences of climate variability and climate change to the drought events in the northern Thailand during monsoon rainfall (June-September) 1981– 2018.
The ENSO mechanisms and their impacts are taken into account on this analysis in term of the principal component.
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed to reveal the link between the ENSO impacts and drought events in the northern Thailand under global warming.
The Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) is also performed to truncate the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly and Gamma distribution is applied to fitting the monthly precipitation data as a Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
The results show that the average drought period changes from 7.5 years in 1981-1995 to a new average period of 5 years since 1996 onwards in terms of many SPI time scales (e.g.
"SPI3, SPI6 and SPI12)."
"Under the climate change forcing, it clearly shows the correlation that the signal of strong ENSO events affects the drought periods in Northern Thailand more frequently for the last two decades."

"Nowadays, the plastics industry plays an essential role in the country's internal and external industries."
"Especially assembled products, product quality is an essential aspect of production."
There are various product problems.
Shrinkage is an inevitable problem with plastic products.
"This research is to determine the factors that affect the shrinkage of the screw cap of the plastic bottle made of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) material, where the shrinkage of the workpiece affects the assembly between the screw cap of the water bottle and the water bottle."
"Therefore, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) experimental design principles was used to determine the factor affecting the shrinkage of the workpiece, namely the melt temperature of plastic (Tm), mold temperature (Tw), and cooling temperature (Tc)."
The 9 (8+1) experiments were performed with 2 replications at a confidence level of (α) 95 %.
"A total of 18 experiments found that the significant relevant factor affecting the shrinkage of the bottle cap specimens was the melting temperature of plastic (Tm) of 190 oC, the mold temperature (Tw) of 60 oC and cooling temperature (Tc) is 45 oC, with a minimum shrinkage of 1.39% and can be found that defects decreasing were 12.08%."

This paper provides the design equation evaluating the gains of non-ideal proportional plus resonant controller also known as non-ideal PR controller.
The control system of single-phase grid-tied inverter typically embraces such a PR controller governing grid-current.
The design equation is originated and developed from the characteristic equation of the closed-loop control system.
Either two distinct negative real closed-loop poles or one complex-conjugate pair of closed-loop poles with negative real part are required for the PR gain computations of the design equation.
Root-locus consideration will place the two distinct negative real poles whilst specification of transient response will assign the one complex-conjugate pair of poles.
The PR controller has to carry its gains so that the closed-loop system becomes stable.
Simulation results compare transient responses of grid current derived from entering two different couples of closed-loop poles into the design equation and then allowing it to run.
Grid-current response tracking its reference and synchronization between grid current and grid voltage in steady state are accomplished under experiments on the control system.
"Thus, the proposed design equation is an alternative way for tuning the gains of the PR controller in practice."

This study focused on a treatment of wet coffee processing wastewater using suspended and biofilm microalgae cultivation.
"Moreover, this study also investigated the microalgal biomass production in biofilm microalgae system at the differences in harvesting frequency."
Mixed-microalgae culture was cultivated in the laboratory scale and constructed under outdoor climatic conditions in Northern Thailand.
"Three different systems were used, which were suspended system, biofilm system (harvesting at day 7 and 14) and biofilm system (harvesting at day 14)."
These three systems were cultivated for 3 cycles with the period of 14 days for each cycle.
"The results showed that biofilm system (harvesting at day 7 and 14) gave the highest removals of dissolved TKN-N, PO43--P, and COD, which removed on average 48%, 44%, and 90%, respectively."
"Another two systems had lower average removal efficiencies of dissolved TKN-N, PO43--P, and COD."
These results could be explained by the minimization of light limitation to photosynthesis and enhancement of CO2 mass transfer when using biofilm system.
"However, this study showed that microalgal biomass harvesting in biofilm system at day 7 caused less mixed-microalgae seed."
"Consequently, biofilm system (harvesting at day 7 and 14) had lower average biomass production rate (1.02 g dry weight/day) than biofilm system (harvesting at day 14) (1.19 g dry weight/day)."
This study provided a development of efficient treatment for the wet coffee processing wastewater using microalgae cultivation in biofilm system.
"Moreover, only half biomass harvesting of the patterned sheet in day 7 and all biomass harvesting in day 14 should be applied to increase microalgal biomass production."

This paper presents the performance comparison of harmonic elimination in electric railway systems with two shunt active power filter (SAPF) structures: split capacitor structure and joint capacitor structure.
"The indicators of the comparison for the two SAPF structures are the total current harmonic distortion (%THDI), the ripple of DC bus voltage (% VDC(ripple)) and the dynamic response of DC bus voltage during load changes."
"The harmonic detection, synchronous reference frame (SRF method) is used for calculating the reference current of both SAPF structures."
The conventional PI controllers are used to control the compensating current and regulate the DC bus voltage of SAPF.
The hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation technique which process by Simulink/MATLAB program and TMS320C2000TM Experimenter Kit board is applied to simulate harmonic elimination in AC-electric railway systems.
The simulation results show that both SAPF structures can provide good performance for harmonic elimination and the %THDI of source current after compensation are satisfied under the IEEE std 519-2014.
"Furthermore, the SAPF with joint capacitor structure gives less ripple of DC bus voltage than the split capacitor structure."
"However, the split capacitor structure has better dynamic response than the joint capacitor structure when loads in the system have been changed and greatly increased."

"minimize cycle time, minimize the number of stations, minimize different workload between workstations, and minimize index of task-unrelated."
The experiment results show that MOEA/D obtains better performance than the Combinatorial Optimization with Coincidence (COIN) algorithm in terms of convergence which is the main concern of algorithm comparison.
"Although, its spread and CPU time are inferior to COIN."
Mixed-Model Parallel U-shaped assembly line balancing problem under many-Objectives is known as NP-hard problems.
"Hence, to optimize this problem, heuristic approaches need to be developed."
"This research proposes a decode method and a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) for solving the problem by optimizing four objectives simultaneously, i.e."
"minimize the number of workstations, minimize the number of stations, minimize different workload between workstations, and minimize work unrelatedness."
The experiment results show that MOEA/D has better performance than BBO in terms of convergence.
"However, its spread and CPU time indicators are not better than BBO."
This research aimed to study the effects of chord line size changing and angle blade pitch adjustment on rotational speed and torque of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT).
The turbine blades used in this study were airfoil type and were in accordance with the NACA 2412.

"After a long period of service, the cracks are possible."
"Based on the linear-elastic fracture mechanics, the complete fracture of crack can occur if the stress intensity factor (K) at crack tip is equal or greater than the critical stress intensity factor (Kc) of material."
"At present, the calculation of K proposed by the fitness-for-service assessment standard (API-579-1/ASME FFS-1) is wildly applied for the cracked pipelines."
"However, the precision of K depends on the interpolation method of influence coefficients (G0, G1, G2, G3, G4) within the K solution."
"Therefore, 38 case studies of the longitudinal internal surface crack in a pipeline under internal pressure were selected to analyze the effect of interpolation method on the precision of K. The methodology covered both linear and nonlinear interpolations."
The precisions of K from various interpolation methods were determined by comparing the results with K calculated by finite element analysis.
"It was found that the Ks from the linear interpolation were significantly different from those from the finite element analysis, i.e., the maximum difference of 25% for very small thickness pipe, and the maximum difference of 16% for small thickness pipe."
"While, the differences between the Ks from the cubic spline interpolation using 5 data of t/Ri and the finite element analysis were lower, i.e., the maximum difference of 7.3%."
"Therefore, the cubic spline interpolation using 5 data of t/Ri was the most appropriate interpolation method for the K calculation."

"Most geotechnical engineering materials exhibit behaviours responded to the loading rate effect, which are due to their viscous property, e.g., creep (CP) by sustained loading, stress relaxation (SR) by keeping the strain constant, stress jump upon a stepwise change in the strain rate, etc."
Precise prediction of creep strain is important for evaluation of the long-term performance of a soil structure under a constant working load.
This research performed a series of special drained triaxial compression tests on KMUTT sand samples.
Various loading histories were applied so as to evaluate viscosity type and investigate the CP and SR behaviours at various values of stress ratio.
An analytical framework was developed from systematic relationships between the elapsed times necessary to reach the same irreversible strain rate in CP and SR tests and those between the irreversible strain increments necessary to reach the same irreversible strain rate in CP and SR tests.
The followings are found.
KMUTT sand exhibits the behaviours responded to the loading rate effect by which the viscosity type is TESRA in the pre-peak regime translated to P&N in the post-peak regime.
Time history of CP can be precisely predicted by time history of SR performed for a much shorter time.
"And, time factor from the prediction increases with increasing stress ratio."

This paper proposes an appropriate ordering policy for imported raw materials by adopting in joint-ordering and full container load (FCL) concept in order to reduce total cost including transportation cost and inventory holding cost while maintaining service level at 95%.
This study was conducted as follows.
"Firstly, all relevant data (e.g., imported raw materials data and purchasing conditions) is reviewed."
"Secondly, the periodic review ordering policy type, i.e., OUL policy is proposed."
The ordering quantity is determined by adjusting OUL policy in order to integrate joint replenishment and full container load concept.
"Three candidate policies are suggested: 1) Adjusting ordering quantity only based on average demand  2) Adjusting ordering quantity based on average demand and raw materials price, and 3) Adjusting ordering quantity based on average demand , raw materials price and variance of demand."
"Thirdly, the three candidate policies are evaluated by a simulation model."
The most appropriate ordering policy must meet lowest average total cost and variation.
"Finally, a sensitivity analysis is done on the selected policy to show how changing in average demand and standard deviation of demand affects the total cost and service level."
The results show that the most appropriate ordering policy is to adjust the OUL policy based on average demand () only.
"When implementing the proposed policy with the actual demand of 2019, it also shows that the total cost, transportation cost, and inventory holding cost have been decreased by 34%, 44% and 24% respectively while achieving the desired service level."
"Finally, the sensitivity analysis result shows that the proposed policy is robust to changes in demand pattern."
There is only 10%-11% changes in total cost compared to 50% changes in average demand and more variation or worst-case scenario for demand changes.

Induction machines have widely been used in many industrial factories.
"In the case of emergency, braking torque is always needed."
One of the simple braking methods is dc current injection.
"In order to stop the machines in efficient manner with a desired operating time, their accurate speed-torque curves in the braking zone are often required."
It has been reported in the open literature that machine’s braking torque curve calculations have not yet been fully completed so far due to an ignorance of their nonlinear effects.
"Thus, this paper presents an extension to the braking torque-speed curve calculation of induction machines under dc injection braking."
The saturation of mutual and rotor-leakage reactances as well as the slip-dependent rotor resistance are entirely taken into account.
"To validate the proposed model, the braking torque-speed curves between calculation and laboratory measurement are compared."
A good agreement is observed in the satisfactory manner.
"Moreover, an application of the proposed torque-speed curve in determining the machine’s braking time is demonstrated."
An acceptable accuracy in the breaking times between calculation and measurement approaches is shown.

Efficient mixing is required in various industries to require homogeneity and system consistency.
DC motor speed control is important for mixing processes.
"In this study, proportional integral (PI) controllers and proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers with simple first order filters designed in MATLAB/Simulink are compared using three different tuning methods such as Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) step response, Chien-Hrones-Reswick (CHR) step response and Closed-loop Pole placement design methods."
The purpose of DC motor speed control is to respond quickly without overshoot to prevent damage to the DC motor.
"Therefore, Kalman filter is considered to eliminate the occurrence of excessive overshoot."
The motor output signal is detected by an encoder and is then converted to revolutions per minute unit (rpm) before going through the noise reduction and the controller respectively.
The motor input is a pulse width modulation (PWM) cycle signal which is set in the range of 0-255.
Experimental results show that the Kalman filter is excellent in all cases the noise and excessive overshoot of the DC motor speed.
It can also accurately assess its state and can be used to reduce the aggressiveness of DC motor responses.
The DC motor speed control performance of the controllers based three different tuning methods are also compared.
It found that the PID controller based pole placement tuning method with the Kalman filter provide the most efficient response without overshoot for all desired speed values.
"This research aims to study the effect of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) and limestone powder (LP) on threshold chloride content, the depassivation time of steel and compressive strength of concrete containing GGBFS and LP."
"The GGBFS was used as a partial replacement of binder at the replacement percentage of 30%, 40%, 50% and 70% and LP was used to replace the binder at the replacement percentage of 5%, 10% and 15%."
The water to binder ratio of 0.50 and covering depth of 2 cm were used.
The results showed that the threshold chloride content and depassivation time of concrete containing GGBFS and LP was higher than that of cement-only concrete.
Concrete with GGBFS had lower threshold chloride content and longer depassivation time with increasing binder replacement content by GGBFS.
"The use of LP at 5% binder replacement in concrete containing GGBFS gave higher compressive strength of concrete, longer depassivation time of steel and higher corrosion resistance index of steel in concrete."
Behaviours of reinforced soil are affected by the ultimate tensile strength (Tult) of geogrid and the vertical spacing (Sv) of arrangement.
"Basically, the concept inferred from the current design approach of a reinforced-soil retaining wall shows that, if the Tult-to-Sv (or TVR) ratio is kept the same, the outcoming performance is also the same."
"In this research, a series of triaxial compression tests was performed with sand either unreinforced or reinforced with polypropylene geogrids having four different Tult values."
Number of geogrid layers and Sv were adjusted so as to obtain three different TVR values.
Effects of varying Tult and TVR values were studied by comparing the compressive strength (Rmax) and Poisson’s ratio (nsec) among different geogrid-reinforced sand samples.
"From the results of this study, the followings are found."
"By comparing at the same TVR, the Rmax decreases, while the nsec increases or the lateral deformation increases, with increasing Tult."
This implies that the performance of reinforcing with the geogrids having lower Tult but are closely spaced is better than that of reinforcing with the geogrids having higher Tult but are coarsely spaced.
"On the other hand, when comparing at the same Tult, the Rmax increases, while the nsec decreases, with increasing TVR, because of the increasing of reinforcing density."
"The influences of Tult and TVR on the Rmax and nsec can be explained by the development of deterministic zone resulted from no connection between the geogrid and facing at the end, which negatively affect the transferring of the tensile force mobilised in the geogrid to additional confining pressure to sand."

"The purposes of this research were 1) to numerically investigate the soil resistance against the pile group supporting a large billboard sign in the Bangkok area, and 2) to study the p-multipliers for a laterally-loaded pile in a group subjected to wind load."
The three-dimensional finite element analysis was performed and created graphically using a standard set of commands in the ABAQUS/CAE package.
"To simulate the behaviors of soil and pile foundations subjected to wind load acting on a large billboard sign, the virtual interface element technique was employed to relatively control and monitor the pile-soil-pile interaction when the lateral movement was induced."
The effective interface element thickness was assigned to be 10% of the pile diameter.
The research results revealed two findings.
"First, the lateral soil resistance against the piles was found to be at its ultimate value at the topmost layer near the existing ground, the so-called critical depth at about 2 times of the pile diameter at its widest part, when considering the maximum wind loads applied to the billboard sign according to Building Control Acts."
It was found that piles installed in the leading row resisted larger lateral stress distribution than those in the trailing row.
"Second, the  p-multipliers of piles in the leading and trailing row were equal to 0.884 and 0.772, respectively."
"This is due to the fact that the pile-soil-pile interaction induced among piles within a group and surrounding soil, are dependent on the position of each pile in a group and also the direction of the lateral load applied to the pile foundation."
This research designed a mixture of biomass to generate electricity using coconut husk mixed with wood chips.
"The biomass mixing model took 6 forms, with the proportion of mixing between coconut flakes and wood chips as follows: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1, 3:2 and 4:1."
Each model was tested for electricity production for a period of 24 hours.
"To analyze the return on investment and payback period, the results showed which of the 6 types of fuel mixture were able to generate sufficient heat and pressure to meet the demand for electricity."
The model 3 fuel mixture provided the maximum heat energy with fuel that can be sold at a level of 68.07%.
The use of 1 part coconut husk and 3 parts wood chips increases the cost of fuel leading to a difference in fuel cost and electricity that can be sold.
"When calculating the costs and analyzing the economic value, the researcher determined that model 4 has a return on investment (B / C) of 1.33, with a payback period of 3.93 years."
"Therefore, the proportion of coconut husk and wood chips (model 2:1) is considered to be the most appropriate."

"It was Chom Nan Park, the garden in honor of His Majesty the King's 80th Birthday Anniversary located in Project 1, Phitsanulok Province."
"Data was collected by the observation method, and analysis was carried out via descriptive statistics using the chi-square method."
"From the observation of 294 sample groups the results showed that the most common social interaction pattern was person-to-person (53.4%), followed by an individual with a group of 3-5 people (25.85%), whilst the least common was the group interaction type (2.72%)."
"This study indicates that the social interaction of the elderly is similar to that of the general population in other age groups, yet there may be differences in the activity and duration that occur according to the condition of the elderly person’s body."
"The social interaction of the elderly is primarily just small group interaction, mostly with people they know, for example with friends or family members."
The results of the relationship test between the physical characteristics of the open public space and the social interaction of the elderly found only 5 relationships.
"However in order for the public space to fully meet the needs of the elderly, the researcher considers that other factors, not only interaction, should be taken into account."
"Such factors include designing an open space that is friendly to the elderly, creating an environment that is close to nature, improving the aesthetics of the environment, and making it conducive to recreation so helping the elderly to improve their health."
Consideration of the satisfaction factor of the elderly is something that should be given priority.
This is what all those involved within the design process should pay attention to so that the open public spaces can truly cater to the needs of people of all ages.

"The purpose of this study were to investigate the management process and preparation of helping flood victims of related sectors in Phitsanulok Province, and develop a simulation model for flood risk area prediction in Phitsanulok Province by using the Geographic Information System (GIS)."
"Based on the prediction model, six levels of water when flooding were divided: 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m, 2.5 m, and 3.0 m. Knowing the flood risk areas through levels of water could be useful for warning of floods in terms of the distance and time for the rescuers to reach the areas."
The results of the assessment of related sectors to have access to the flood risk areas showed that their service areas did cover all risk areas in Phitsanulok Province.
"Thus, it was suggested that six flood relief operation centers should be established to help flood victims efficiently in Bangkrathum District, Bangrakam District, and Phromphiram District."
"In addition, the prediction model will help to improve the planning process to help flood victims efficiently."
Drying is a process of reducing moisture content of a product to extend shelf life and increase product value.
"It is generally known that energy consumption of drying is rather high; therefore, a development of dryer using renewable energy as a heating source is necessary."
"For this reason, the performance enhancement of solar dryer using ventilation fan control was studied in this research."
The criterion used for turning on-off the ventilation fan was the difference between relative humidity of the air at the inlet and outlet of the drying chamber.
"The four models of solar dryers were constructed by using four different drying techniques to assess the performance of the passive solar dryer (PSD) and solar dryers equipped with relative humidity difference control of 5% (SD-RH5), 10% (SD-RH10) and 15% (SD-RH15), respectively."
Pork with the initial moisture content of 265±2% dry basis was selected as the sampling material.
"The criteria used to evaluate the solar dryer performance are drying rate, solar dryer efficiency and specific energy consumption."
The experimental results showed that the performance of solar dryer could be improved by using ventilation fan control technique.
"Also, the SD-RH10 performance was higher than that of SD-RH5, SD-RH15 and PSD."
"In addition, the drying rate of SD-RH10 was higher than that for SD-RH5, SD-RH15 and PSD by approximately 1.93%, 3.38% and 3.38%, respectively."
"Moreover, the specific energy consumption of SD-RH10 was lower than that for SD-RH5, SD-RH15 and PSD by around 7.54%, 2.16% and 1.86%, respectively."
"Finally, solar dryer efficiencies of PSD, SD-RH5, SD-RH10 and SD-RH15 were about 8.47%, 8.11%, 8.68% and 8.46%, respectively."
Removal of a small amount of carbon monoxide from reformed gas before feeding it to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is crucial to be done in order to prolong the lifetime of PEMFC because carbon monoxide is poisonous to platinum-based anode of PEM fuel cell.
The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of catalytic activities of CuO/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by sol gel and single-step sol gel methods get rid of the carbon monoxide when there is too much nitrogen by means of burning carbon monoxide.

"This research aimed to study operating principles of steam-powered thermal water pump, the use of various heat sources, height level study, coolant quantity and temperature, and air quantity in the system affecting driving and pumping water."
"From the previous studies, it was found that using steam to drive and pump water was a way to increase pumping capacity."
This was relied on the steam power produced to drive water and release heat by the coolant.
"Reducing the coolant temperature, increasing the coolant volume, and direct water cooling allowed the system to pump water at greater depths."
This was due to fast dropping temperature in the tank leading to condensation and vacuum pressure.
"Therefore, as the temperature inside the tank dropped, the absolute pressure also dropped, so the system was able to pump at a higher level."
"Moreover, the proportion of air inside the system could increase the water-driving pressure."
"Therefore, after driving water was completed, the air inside the system had to be released along with steam ventilation to get the system pressure to be as close to the atmospheric pressure as possible."
"Condensation was still problematic because air collapse was difficult, so the system needed filling new air in every operating cycle."
"In terms of pump efficiency, it depended on the input power into the system and the amount of water pumped and the total height of water pumping."
"Therefore, reducing the temperature inside the pumping tank during the cooling process was able to increase the vacuum pressure, and this allowed the system to pump at a greater depth."
To increase pump efficiency by reducing the loss of energy supplied to the system can be achieved by increasing the number of operating cycles that is more than one cycle.
"In addition, by increasing the amount of water pumped per cycle and increasing the pump tank size when the system can pump water at a higher level, the pump efficiency is also increased."
"This research has three objectives as follows, first, to study the characteristics of the ceramic souvenir product designs in Ban Taohai, Phitsanulok; second, to design new souvenir products that reflect the Ban Taohai identity; and third, to evaluate the newly developed ceramic souvenir products."

This research was focused on analyzing production and logistics cost of growing hydroponic and organic salad vegetables in Nakhon Sawan Province.
Activity-based costing was used to analyze the cost in each activity of growing salad vegetables.
This was conducted to reduce the production cost of the two methods of salad vegetable growing to be competitive with other markets.
Purposive sampling was used.
The data were collected by having an in-depth interview with ten entrepreneurs growing salad vegetables and their employees.
The results were found that the total production and logistics cost of growing hydroponic salad vegetables was higher than that of growing organic ones.
"In summer, the mean of the total cost of growing hydroponic and organic salad vegetables was 128 bahts per kilogram and 75-178 bahts per kilogram, respectively."
"The hydroponic entrepreneur 2 lost all of his vegetables due to the extremely hot air and water, so he cancelled his production during the summer."
"The cost of growing hydroponically and organically, 68-69 bahts per kilogram and 35-33 bahts per kilogram, respectively, was at the lowest level in the cold season."
The production cost ratio was higher than the logistics cost ratio.
"This was because of the high cost on labor hiring, 70% of the total production cost."
"The highest cost of the logistics activity was the transportation cost, 60% of the total logistics cost."
"Therefore, the approach to reduce production and logistics cost can be done by increasing products per growing areas and appropriate production and logistics management for business ecosystem as well as farming season."
Most of the manufacturing processes in Thailand are characterized as separate processes.
Supplies are transported from the starting location to the next location.
This paper presents the design and development of a low-cost Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for supply transporting during each production process.
The size of load does not exceed 10 kilograms and the AGV is designed from the concept of a power unit of a stepping motor.

Heat exchangers form a vital part of absorption chillers.
Majority of research works utilizeLMTD (Log Mean Temperature Difference) methodfor their analysis anddevelopmentof absorptionchillers.
"However, this method has some limitations."
The fluid inlet and outlet temperaturesmust be known or readily determined from the energy balance equations.
The value of log meantemperature difference for the heat exchanger may then be determined.
"Practically, the outlettemperatures are unknown for the design of absorption chillers."
"If only the inlet temperatures areknown, use of the LMTD method requires an iterative procedure."
"This research work proposedan alternative approach, termed the effectiveness-NTU method."
"The study results show that coldfluid heat capacity rate is always higher than hot fluid heat capacity rate because of 3 factors.Firstly, the mass flow rate of solution leaving from absorber is always higher than the massflow rate of solution leaving from the generator."
"Secondary, the specific heat of LiBr solution isa function of solution concentration and the concentration of solution leaving from absorber isalways lower than the concentration of solution leaving from the generator."
"Thirdly, the fluidheat capacity rate is the product of mass flow rate and specific heat of LiBr solution."
This effectto the constraint of designed temperature outlets and also the performance of heat exchangerused in absorption chiller.

"This paper proposes the algorithm for optimal design of a stand-alone powersystem consisting of wind, PV and pumped hydro storage, taking into consideration theexpected energy not supplied."
The algorithm consists of two stages which employ thesame problem formulation.
The problem formulation uses the capital costs of the standalonepower system together with the cost of expected energy not supplied as an objectivefunction.
"The constraint functions consist of load profiles of medium general service fromProvincial Electricity Authority (PEA), the statistical forecasting data of wind and solarenergy, and the operation of pumped hydro storage system."
The calculation in the firststage ensures that there is no expected energy not supplied.
"The optimal results withzero load shedding from the first stage yield the number of PV units, the number of windturbines, the rated capacity of pump motor and hydro turbine, and the maximum volumeof the upper reservoir for storage system."
Then these optimal results are fed back intothe formulation as fixed parameters in the second stage calculation.
"The calculation isdone on the system with various probabilities of solar and wind energy in order to obtainthe minimum costs of load shedding when shortage of wind and solar energy should occur.The results of the second stage show the operating cycles of pump and hydro turbine,and the changed volumes of water in the reservoir in all considered periods."
The resultsfrom both stages of the algorithm show the additional costs of energy not supplied whenthe probabilistic values of renewable energy are taking into consideration in the optimaldesign of the stand-alone system.

This research is a study of the factors influencing toward the overhead cost for the residential construction projects in Bangkok Metropolitan and vicinity area by sending questionnaires to 100 contractors.
"Among those, 69 companies returned valid questionnaires for the analysis."
"The research was to study various components of the overhead cost for the residential construction projects, influential factors and their levels in order to find a guideline in controlling and reducing the overhead cost of any residential construction project."
The overhead costs incurred in the main office and on the job site could be classified into 10 groups consisting of 59 subgroups.
"The most problematic group which was hard to control was utilizing equipment, machines and vehicles on the job site in which the average evaluation score was 3.34 of 5.00."
"The top five most problematic subgroups were employee’s salary, cost of machinery’s acquisition, cost of equipment’s renting, cost of setting up field office and cost of fuel, in which the average evaluation score was 3.57-3.75."
The analysis presented that the contractors estimated their average overhead cost before construction at 11.55 percent of the project’s value that was less than the actual overhead cost after the project’s completion which was found to be 13.26 percent.
"Construction contractors should have overhead cost estimate method considering all related factors, record overhead costs from previous projects for future projects cost estimate, especially, factors that have direct impact to project overhead costs."
"The research results could be used as a guideline for estimating and controlling of overhead costs for contractors, as a result reducing project total costs."

The use of local materials or off-specification materials stabilized with cement for minimizingnatural resource and environmental impacts is one of the cost-effective solutions in highwayconstruction and rehabilitation.
"If the cement content and the 7-day unconfined compressivestrength (UCS) of cement stabilized materials can be estimated prior to the mix design process,this will provide the practitioners with a guideline for local material selection and suitable amountof cement to meet the UCS according to the design specification."
This paper is to evaluate theempirical equations for predicting the UCS of three types of cement stabilized materials e.g.
"(1)cement modified crushed rock base, (2) pavement recycling base, and (3) soil-cement subbase.Since there was no standard and acceptable method for predicting the 7-day UCS of cementstabilized materials at the present in Thailand, the prediction equations proposed by Sunitsakulet al."
and Kasidit et al.
were considered in this study to estimate the UCS of these three typesof cement stabilized materials.
"Based on 270 test data, a comparison between the UCS obtainedfrom the laboratory tests and that obtained from the prediction equations suggested that anequation by Sunitsakul et al."
was more accurate and precise than that of Kasidit et al.
"One of the cultural heritages, “The stucco on Jaroenrat 31 Bridge located in the city of Bangkok” shows an important trace of the Thai nation history."
"In the present day, this culturalheritage is damaged and deteriorated rapidly as the time goes by."
The stucco on Jaroenrat 31 Bridge is significantly distinct from those on other bridges that are low reliefs.
"The stucco on Jaroenrat 31 Bridge are, however, both high reliefs and floating 3D sculptures."
"Moreover, the stucco is very large in terms of width and height so that it is difficult to divide the 3D scanning into pieces."
"In this research, 3D scanning on a crane is then adopted in this project in order to facilitate the scanning outside the bridge."
Plaster copy making is also done in order to check the repeatability by 4-axis CNC machining.
These 3D digital copies of the stucco are suitable either for partial repair or for reconstruction of the whole bridge because they provide the layout as well as the detail of the stucco and the bridge.
"These 3D digital copies of the stucco have been delivered to the Office of Archaeology, Fine Arts Department, Ministry of Culture in order to be used as references for repairing the bridge causing by the construction of Sanamchai Subway Station."
"The digital copies can also be used in the future conservation, restoration, as well as the references for the future studies."
"Normally, general investors emphasize only investment cost but don’t concern with maintenance cost in civil engineering construction work."
The maintenance cost might mainly causes increase of the construction budget and might progress to lack of the construction project due to out of construction damage plan.
"These directly lead to purpose of this research, which is study on the risk assessment and the appropriateness of cost usage; initial capital and maintenance cost; for flood protection of I-walls and Embankment dike type."
The risk assessment was derived from potential damage of each type.
"There are 4 variable of the risk assessment: cause, effect, difficulty in maintenance, and repair."
"Moreover, suitability of initial cost can be obtained from the principle calculation of life time using cost (life cycles) in order to analysis and summary."
"Therefore, the results of this study can confirm that building cost of I-walls type is low, but maintenance cost of that high."
The embankment dike can divided to 2 type: with geocell and with concrete slab.
"First type, building cost of geocell embankment dike is high, but maintenance cost of that is low."
"On the hand, building and maintenance cost of concrete slab embankment dike is high."
"Finally, the advantage of this study is simply determinable type of flood protection construction for investor."
Seismic analysis of vertical steel vessels can be performed by using an equivalent static force procedure and a dynamic analysis method.
The equivalent static method is commonly used to determine earthquake load because it is a simple design method.
"However, a dynamic analysis may be required in the case of unusual structures that have significant irregularities in mass, such as vertical steel vessels with differences in mass distribution."
This study aimed to evaluate the seismic response of vertical steel vessels by comparing the results of base shear and overturning moment between the equivalent static method and modal response spectrum analysis by simplified model and 3D finite element model that used STAAD Pro for creating the geometry of a vertical steel vessel.
"The acceleration used for seismic analysis of Bangkok’s soft soil area (Zone 5), referring to the standard for earthquake-resistant design of structures (DPT."
"1302-52), depends on the period of vibration on the vertical steel vessel in each load case."
"The results of the study indicated that almost all analytical models by dynamic analysis method resulted in base shear around 25-36% lower than that analyzed by the equivalent static method for empty condition and 23-32% for operation condition, excluding the simplified model (single lumped mass model), which yielded base shear close to the equivalent static analysis method at 2.7% and 1.7% higher for the empty and operation conditions, respectively."

This article was a study of the possibility of using recyclable waste concrete in high strength self-compacting concrete.
"The waste concrete was cylindrical specimens with 150 mm diameter and 300 mm height, and 150 mm cubes which were aged 1-2 years."
The waste concrete was crushed into a 20 mm maximum nominal size to use as a coarse aggregate.
"Self-compacting concrete with water to binder ratio of 0.35 was used as controlled concrete (PC), in which the target compressive strength of 100 mm cubes was 70 MPa at the age of 28 days."
"The PC concrete mixture was replaced crushed limestone with crushed recycled concrete aggregate, and the cement was partially replaced by class C fly ash at the dosage of 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% by weight of the binder to produce concrete (CA, 20FA, 40FA, and 60FA concrete, respectively)."
The slump flow was controlled in the range of 650-750 mm.
"The compressive strength, porosity, electrical resistivity, and non-steady state chloride migration were investigated."
"From the experimental results, it was found that the compressive strength of CA concrete was lower than that of PC controlled concrete but higher than the target compressive strength."
The CA concrete had higher the porosity and the chloride diffusion coefficient and lower the electrical resistivity than that of PC controlled concrete at the age of 28 days.
"The compressive strength of concrete containing fly ash was higher than the target compressive strength at the age of 90 days, except the 20FA concrete was higher at the age of 28 days."
The chloride penetration resistance of concrete containing fly ash was higher than that of PC control concrete.
The tendency of the chloride penetration resistance increased with containing the fly ash increased at the age of 90 days.
Collectors roads are the roads that distribute traffic flows from the arterial roads.
This kind of road plays an important role in the people journey within their community.
"Thus, characteristic and behavior of collector road users differ from the user of other types of road."
The Value of Time of the collector road can be calculated using the wage rate method.
"For that calculation, there are 9 parameters which are personal income, percentage of passenger cars, income factor, hourly wage, travel purpose, number of passengers in vehicle, Value of Time by each vehicle type, proportion of each vehicle type, and Passenger Car Equivalent Factor (PCE Factor)."
"From the analysis, 3 crucial parameters for VOT calculation were found, i.e., percentage of passenger cars, travel purpose, and personal income."
"After the data analysis, collector road users who travel by passenger car are the highest income person."
"The average monthly income of samples from RO.3044 and NK.3009 are 21,106.32 Baht and 24,119.05 Baht respectively."
"Most of the travelers, who use passenger car, are high income person, and their travel purpose is for business."
These three reasons affect the Value of Time.
"Thus, Values of Time for RO.3044 and NK.3009 are 232.33 Baht per PCU- hour and 217.72 Baht per PCU- hour respectively."
"Information from 3D structural models, unit costs of construction material and labors, construction productivity rates and project simulations were integrated to estimate construction costs and time required for building construction."
Construction costs and time differences between a reinforced concrete and a structural steel buildings were also determined.
"The two types of structure were subjected to identical requirements, building area and usage."
The 3D structural models were created to determine amounts of material to be used for entire projects.
"The unit costs of construction material and the productivity rates were applied to evaluate material costs and activity durations, respectively."
The estimated durations were used in conjunction with unit cost of labors to yield labor costs.
Simulation models were developed and simulation runs were performed to determine project durations.
The simulation models were validated by comparing the project durations predicted from the simulation runs with those calculated from critical path method (CPM).
It was found that the project durations obtained from the two methodologies were consistent.
"In addition, when using simulations, some special conditions may be added to models, making simulation results more realistic."
"It can be seen that information from 3D structural models, unit prices, productivity rates, and project simulation were able to be integrated for the determination of construction costs and time as required."
"The findings also indicated that, for the projects in this study, steel structure construction cost was 39% higher than that of reinforced concrete, while construction duration of the latter was 69% longer."
This research has studied the properties of briquette fuel from coconut shell components and coconut grease waste.
"The objectives of this study are to examine the optimal proportion and to investigate the fuel properties from coconut grease waste, husk residues and coconut dust by cold-press technique."
Pretest set is conducted to compare the better properties and combustion time between dry period 30 and 60 min at the temperature of 105°C.
"The biomass briquettes are produced using mixing coconut grease waste: coconut dust: husk residues in seven percentages ratios of 70:30:0, 75:15:10, 80:10:10, 85:10:5, 90:8:2, 90:10:0 and 95:3:2."
"The chemical properties studied included heating value, moisture content, volatile matters, fixed carbon and bottom ash are analyzed according to ASTM standards."
The pretest results show the lowest moisture content and longest ignition point time (6-9 min) at 60-min dry period.
"Therefore, the optimum ratio is investigated at 60-min dry period and indicates that 75: 15 :10 (coconut grease waste: coconut dust: husk residues) is the optimum ratio with 6,660 kcal/kg heating value, 4.00% moisture content, 7.97% fixed carbon, 84.10% volatile matters and 4.00% bottom ash."
"The heating value of briquette fuel in this study meets the requirement of Thai Community Production Standard 238/2547 which has the standard heating value of charcoal briquette not less than 5,000 (kcal/kg)."
"However, the moisture content value is achieved the standard which should below 8%."
"Therefore, briquette fuel from coconut shell and coconut grease waste has a higher heating value than briquette charcoal and other biomass charcoal."
"Therefore, it demonstrates that it can use as a renewable energy and save the environment."
"The purpose of this research is to study the earthquake effect to liquefaction potential in Phayao Province, measuring 6.3 Mw, on May 5th, 2014 in Dongmada, Mae Laos, Chiang Rai."

"The objective of this research is to compare the efficiency of concrete repairing by Stitching Dogs by using 3 materials: Steel sheet 1 inch, thickness 3 millimeters, steel round bar diameter 6 millimeters and carbon fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strip by welding using epoxy."
It was also compared with repair by epoxy only and with the original concrete that has not been repaired.
"The repair efficiency was determined by the flexural strength, water permeability and abrasion resistance."
"The test results showed that Stitching Dogs with Steel sheet 1 inch, thickness 3 millimeters will be the most effective, steel round bar diameter 6 millimeters and carbon fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) respectively."
The correlation between the abrasion resistance and the flexural strength was attained as the higher flexural strength was the higher abrasion resistance.
"However, it was not affecting the permeability because the size of the wound repairer was more affected on the permeability."
"In this study, the performance of an air-cooled heat exchanger was evaluated based on entropy generation under variations in operating conditions."
The entropy generation was taken into account the irreversibility associated with heat transfer only.
The predictions were validated and showed good agreement with analytical results and experimental measurements.
The results reveal that the difference temperature between the inlet hot water and the ambient air or the initial temperature difference (ITD) can be used as the parameter to determine the effect of operating conditions.
The heat transfer and entropy generation number increase with increasing ITD.
The entropy generation number slightly increases with mass flow ratio of water to air ( ) and the effecte is less as the ITD is reduced.
The moderate ITD is required for the operation of the air-cooled heat exchanger.
Its limiting temperature ( ) is obtained when the outlet air temperature is minimize.
Working below this value results in over-sensitivity to small change.

Mechanical performance of consolidated sludge-crushed salt mixtures is determined for use as backfilling material in potash mines.
Crushed salt with sizes ranging from 0.075 to 2.35 mm is prepared from Lower member of Maha Sarakham formation.
Sludge has been obtained from the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority of Thailand.
The sludge-to-crushed salt mixtures having weight ratios from 30:70 to 70:30 are compacted to determine their optimum brine contents.
The compacted specimens are then consolidated under constant stresses from 2.5 to 10.0 MPa for up to 30 days.
"The results indicate that compressive strengths, elastic moduli and Poisson’s ratios of the mixtures decrease with increasing sludge contents and increase with consolidation stress and period."
Mixing crushed-salt with sludge can reduce long-term consolidation rate of the mixtures.
This is primarily because sludge composes mainly of fine particles of quartz which can fill voids between crush salt grains.
"Although road condition data, e.g."
"visual distress and ride quality, provide a good indication of the overall network-level road condition, it does not give a direct measure of structural integrity and capacity of a road pavement."
"To address this issue, the road structural condition parameters based on the falling weight deflectometer (FWD) measurements are proposed and implemented in the road deterioration model for Thailand pavement management system (PMS)."

The results showed that the prediction of the soil layer characteristics from KPT shows the characteristics of the soil layer that is more stiffness than the prediction  of results from SPT  at the same depth.
The relationship between the standard penetration test (NSPT) and the Kunzelstab Penetration Test (NKPT) both in the without corrected (N) and corrected value (N¢) tends to be consistent.
"In addition, relationships between NSPT and NKPT in the form of linear equations."
The comparison of the application of KPT and SPT  results in shallow foundation designs showed the consistent results.
"The research objectives are to investigate the compressive strength of the concrete partly composed of sieved basalt dust aggregate as sand substitution, as well as to look into its application in civil engineering."
"The sieved basalt dust ranges from the ratios of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 percentages (only sieved basalt dust aggregate) by weight."
The investigation is through the comparison between the concrete mixed at the water-cement ratios (W/C) 0.45 and W/C 0.65.
The experimental results have shown that the concrete of both mixing ratios provides the highest compressive strength at 60 percentage of sieved basalt dust in place of sand.
The peak strengths are 350 ± 4.50 ksc for W/C 0.45 and 299 ± 10.44 ksc for W/C 0.65.
The strength 350 ± 4.50 ksc is both more reliable and more consistent.
"In comparison between the normally mixed and the two mixing ratio concretes, the former has higher strength about 1.1% and 4.2% respectively."
"For the application viewpoint, the standard of the Department of Public Works and Town & City Planning (DPT) 1101-52 has specified the lowest ultimate compressive strength to be 150, 180, 210 and 240 ksc for the concrete type K1 (general civil construction) K2, K3 and K4."
"Therefore, this concrete with the compressive strength of 350 ksc has high potential to be applied in practical use for various civil structures."
Heat removal from a steam power plant using a thermal chimney is an innovation whereby the air underneath the chimney is heated up by receiving the removed heat from the power plant through a surface heat exchanger.
The heated air flows up the chimney due to a natural convection.
"Theoretical analysis was performed by creating a mathematical model from the fundamental conservation equations in order to study the effect of the chimney shape such as constant area chimney, convergent top chimney, and divergent top chimney."
"Results are presented in comparison with numerical results obtained from ANSYS-CFX, a commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) code."
The results obtained from both approaches were found to be in good agreements.
The divergent top chimney leads to an augmentation of flow and shows good potential in the removal of heat from the power plant.
The maintenance plan of the fire pump system is particularly important for firefighting in petrochemical jetty and terminal.
"The existing maintenance plan still lacked detection of abnormalities, therefore, resulting in many failures of the fire pumps during practicing the emergency plans."
"When measuring the availability of fire pumps, the value was only 65.4%."
"This research, therefore, aimed to improve the maintenance plan by adding methods for detecting abnormalities of the fire pump system."
"The components of the fire pump system in this research consisted of electric motors, diesel engines, and fire pumps."
"In conducting the research, started from 1) analyzing the failures of the components of the fire pump system, 2) arranging the sequence of failures that cause these failures, 3) finding the methods to detect the abnormalities that cause each failure."
"These methods would be defined in the revised maintenance plan, 4) doing according to the maintenance plan."
"The results of the initial phase showed that 9 abnormalities were detected in advance, then the abnormalities were remedied immediately."
"After that, detecting the abnormalities and maintaining according to the revised maintenance plan was performed continuously."
"When monitoring results for one year, there was no further failure."
The research had an objective to present a concept of Energy Management Integration in Thailand i.e.
"energy management according to legislations integrating into energy management system according to International Standard: ISO 50001, by using research methodology with comparisons of contents and regulations towards the presentation of the importance of energy management system according to the International Standard ISO 50001:2018, which was found that both systems required very similar operation procedures, even though they were different in some details."
"Therefore, the organization could further develop an operation of the energy management according to legislations, which has already been operated by the organization."
"At present day, an energy management according to International Standard: ISO 50001 has been improved from the previous ISO 50001:2011 to be ISO 50001:2018."
"Moreover, industrial businesses are also necessary to keep other international standard systems (ISO) such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001."
These ISOs also were improved i.e.
9001:2008 to be ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2004 to be ISO 14001:2015.
"The International Standard Organization (ISO) attempts to improve the structures to be within the same level of the High-Level Structure or HLS on the base of Annex SL, which these standards can be integrated together."
"Therefore, this research took all 3 standards i.e."
"ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 50001:2018 for analyses in details to present the method to help the organization to integrate and management system: ISO 50001:2018 with the system of ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015, which the organization operates or has been certified to the integration with energy management according to legislation."
One of the weaknesses of road construction management is the lack of maintenance management.
"In this case study, it is found that when the machinery used in road construction had a chronic abnormality and there was no correction, therefore, causing more damage until unable to work."
"When analyzing the causes of weakness in maintenance management, there were three main causes; (1) lack of maintenance management at the operational, (2) lack of good attitude towards maintenance, and (3) lack of maintenance reporting system."
"This research, therefore, applied the autonomous maintenance and maintenance reporting systems as well as the participatory approach to enhance cooperation, build knowledge and positive attitude towards maintenance work."
"During the research process, the reporting system was implemented to continuously monitor weekly changes."
"After one year and six months, it was found that operational staff had a positive attitude towards maintenance, resulting in the number of machine failures that had to be stopped for more than three days was reduced by an average of 52%, availability had increased by an average of 29%."
"In addition, repairing costs were reduced by 86%."
The objective of this research was to study the properties of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) mixed with calcium carbonate and fly ash.
"Portland cements type 1 was replaced by calcium carbonate at ratios of 5%, 10% and 20% by weight and fly ash at ratios of 20%, 30%, and 50% respectively."
The total powder material content was 550 kg/m3 and water to powder ratio was kept constant at 0.28 for all mixtures.
"Properties of SCC including, workability, compressive strength and drying shrinkage were tested."
The results indicated that SCC workability was increased by increasing fly ash content.
"At the same time, compressive strength was decreased by increasing calcium carbonate content."
SCC mixtures mixed with a ternary blend of powder materials (FA20CC5) had compressive strength as high as 75.28 MPa at 120 days.
"Currently in Thailand, there are a lot of heavy metals in nature because of waste releasing into nature from industrial factories without having good treatment."
"Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the adsorptive efficiency of soil that used to build waste treatment ponds for further development in the future."
"In the past, a comparative study of the adsorptive efficiency on heavy metals with various types of soil was conducted and found that the soil with the best adsorptive efficiency was clay."
"Hence, this study investigated and compared the adsorptive efficiency on various types of clay in adsorbing heavy metals."
"Three types of adsorbents including 1) Kaolinite clay 2) Illite clay and 3) Montmorillonite clay, and three types of heavy metals including 1) copper (Cu) 2) nickel (Ni) and 3) zinc (Zn) were employed in this study."
"The initial concentration of heavy metals was 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 and 6,000 ppm."
The equilibrium time of adsorption in this research was 2 days.
The method used to test the adsorptive efficiency was Batch test.
"The results of this study suggest that Montmorillonite clay have the best adsorptive efficiency, followed by Illite clay and Kaolinite clay, Montmorillonite clay can adsorb 10 times better than the other two types of clay."
"Copper is the most adsorbed heavy metal solution, follow by nickel and zinc."
The results were consistent with Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
"At present, Thailand is facing the smuggling of wastewater to nature which consists of heavy metal contamination causing soil and water pollution."
"The heavy metals cannot be decomposed naturally and also able to accumulate in humans, animals, and plants."
"Moreover, when getting in large quantities, it can affect the body system."
This laboratory-based study experimented by using bentonite clay to adsorb two heavy metals: copper and zinc.
"Bentonite clay was used and mixed with cement and various pozzolanic materials, consisting of 1) bottom ash 2) fly ash 3) rice husk ash 4) kaolinite 5) blast slag and 6) silica fume with batch adsorption test."
These materials were analyzed for chemical composition and the basic properties of bentonite clay.
The parameters on the adsorption process were the initial concentration of the heavy metal solution and equilibrium time.
The results showed that the adsorption began to enter the equilibrium at 48 hours.
The effects of adsorption capacity by using bentonite clay mixed with cement and pozzolanic materials were analyzed by Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm.
The adsorption capacity of the samples was in the order of bentonite clay mixed with cement > fly ash > bottom ash > blast slag > kaolinite > silica fume > rice husk ash respectively
"This research presents the influence of initial concentrations of heavy metals and temperatures on the ability to absorb copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) with bentonite clay mixed Portland cement."
"Bentonite clay is widely used as a waterproofing material in hazardous waste landfills, The mixture of bentonite clay and Portland cement can increase the adsorption capacity when compared to heavy metal adsorption with bentonite clay."
The results described clearly from a series of batch sorption test and adsorption Isoterm model.
"In the study, varieties of initial concentrations of Cu, Ni and Zn were prepared."
"The adsorption of bentonite clay mixed with Portland cement by batch sorption test showed that during the period of 48 to 120 hours, the concentration of the heavy metal solution entered the equilibrium state and had the potential to adsorb more when the initial concentration of heavy metals increased."
The Langmuir isotherm model can effectively explain the adsorption behavior of bentonite mixed with Portland cement.
The highest amount of absorbed heavy metal solution per approximation (  ) respectively is Cu> Zn> Ni.
The influence of different temperatures affects in the ability to absorb heavy metals; the adsorption increases as the temperature increases.
The rapid growth of industries has led to the increasing of environmental problem.
"Every year, large amount of wastewater has been discharged into rivers without treatment."
The wastewater is often contaminated with high amounts of heavy metals.
Adsorption is one of the methods for heavy metal removal.
Clay have been widely used as the adsorbent for wastewater treatment.
This research focuses on the adsorption of zinc and nickel on bentonite clay when mixing with various Cement and Pozzolanic materials by column leaching test.
"The Pozzolanic materials in this study were 1) fly ash, 2) bottom ash, 3) silica fume, 4) blast furnace slag, 5) metakaolin, and 6) rice husk ash."
The column leaching test was divided into 3 cycles.
The heavy metals solution were released in the first cycle to the example model with continuous flow to simulate the actual condition of wastewater discharging into the soil.
Distilled water was released in the second cycle with continuous flow to simulate the desorption process by rain.
The last cycle was then carried out to verify the adsorption capability after the desorption process.
The adsorption behavior in this study can be illustrated in breakthrough curves.
The breakthrough curves present a relationship between the rates of absorption versus service time.
The retardation factor (R) and Diffusion coefficient (D) can be calculated from breakthrough curves.
"In this study, bentonite mixed with cement showed the highest adsorption performance for both zinc and nickel."
"Bentonite mixed with cement had more retardation factor than bentonite to 1.41 times, and had less diffusion coefficient than bentonite to 4 times."
The adsorption of bentonite decreased when bentonite was mixed with Pozzolanic materials.
The efficiency of pozzolanic materials can be ranked as follows: cement > fly ash > bottom ash > blast furnace slag > metakaolin > silica fume > rice husk ash.
"Comparing the results, it was shown that zinc was adsorbed by bentonite mixed Cement and Pozzolanic materials better than nickel."
The desorption process in second cycle could not fully remove the heavy metals ions from the surface of the adsorption.
The increase of industrial plants is the main cause of various pollution problems and heavy metals are one of the harmful toxins.
One approach to help prevent heavy metals from spilling into nature is to use adsorbent material.
"The objective of this research is to study the capacity to adsorb Copper, Nickel and Zinc of the loess as mixed with sodium bentonite using the batch test and column test."
The batch test was used for finding the equilibrium time and adsorption isotherm based on the adsorption isotherm of Langmuir so as to clarify the adsorption.
The column test was utilized for conducting the adsorption simulation closely similar to the actual condition; to release waste water onto the soil and rinse from the rain water.
"The experimental results showed that in the batch test, bentonite helps to increase the potential for absorbing heavy metals as well as compared with normal loess, where the appropriate ratio for adsorption is loess mixed with 40% bentonite."
"When the time elapsed, the concentration of the heavy metals solution dramatically decreased until reaching the equilibrium state at 48 hours."
The adsorption isotherm of Langmuir performed the explication of the adsorption efficiently.
"The adsorption capacities ( ) were ranked as follows: Copper > Zinc > Nickel: in the column test, it was found that the soil was capable of performing to adsorb heavy metals abundantly in the first period, and then it gradually decreased and leaching of the distilled water was able to less cleanse the heavy metals."
"After leaching, the soil was still able to adsorb the heavy metals but the capacity to adsorb was decreased."
"Nowadays, there are lots of underground construction project in Thailand such as subway construction, underground parking building and culvert."
Retaining wall is the most crucial part for underground construction project because excavation level for these underground structures is very deep below ground surface.
The purpose of this research is to proposed a prediction equations for construction time of diaphragm wall drilled by cable mechanical hang grab.
The proposed equation was validated by the mearing data from MRT Orange Line at Rajamangala Station.
"Construction time of diaphragm wall can be divided into two parts, which are the time of excavation process, Texcand the construction time (after excavation finished),  Taf."
"This research indicated that there are many variables factors affect to the construction time such as size of diaphragm wall, Texc- Vexc relationship and the tine of construction process."
From the Texc- Vexc relationship was found that the sand layer is more difficult excavation than clay layer.
"Moreover, the proposed a prediction equation can help contractors to plan the construction schedule correctly."
"This research study investigated the potential use of Sugar Cane Bagasse Ash, which is by-products from sugar industry, for material substitution in civil engineering works."
Sugar Cane Bagasse Ash (SCA) used in this study was brought from Khon Kaen Sugar Industry Public Company Limited (KSL PLC.)
"The Modified Compaction of SCA mixed with cement at ratios of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% by dry weight was studied."
The results showed that compaction characteristics of cement-mixed sugar cane bagasse ash was visibly obvious.
Cement assisted for better ability to compaction of the materials.
Cement-mixed SCA was coagulated by cementing materials and became clod-like materials.
Experimental results showed the range of Maximum Dry Density (MDD) was between 1300 kg/m3 and 1500 kg/m3.
The average MDD more than 1400 kg/m3 was determined.
The value of MDD of the compacted materials indicated the potential use as materials for the road constructions.
"Compacting water content of 25% was used to prepare specimens for measuring engineering properties, i.e., the values of uniaxial compressive strength and CBR."
The experimental results showed that strength of SCA mixed with of cement between 4% and 10% by dry weight was sufficient to the requirement for subbase and base courses of roads according to the Department of Highways (DOH) standard
The turbulence models are only valid in the turbulence flow which fully developed.
"Near walls, the turbulence Reynolds number is low and turbulence models do not perform well."
The wall functions can be used to model the near wall region efficiently.
"The two-equation turbulence models compose of , , , and  models in OpenFOAM which is the open source software without the license cost and opening to edit codes had been applied with the wall functions for the flow validation."
The 3-D lid-driven cavity flow models by turbulence models were developed to compare with the experiment.
The wall function was applied on walls of the cell structure of each flow model.
The comparison shown that the  model with the wall function of viscous sub-layer () could represent flow behaviour inside the 3-D lid-driven cavity models correctly with the experimental results.
The aim of this research is to design a prototype of male dummy chest for motorcycle crash test.
The unique features of Thai ergonomic body sizes with an age range of the highest fatal rate and the Hybrid III 50th percentile male crash test dummy is primarily used for the criterion design.
A comprehensive experimental study of crush behavior of a prototype undergoing axial compressive loading is performed using a mutual procedure of cadaveric chest testing.
"For design criterion, at the largest chest deflection of 80 mm, the maximum acceleration of 38.43g and absorbed energy of 483.06 joules are considered in experimental results that show a good agreement with experimental data of other research."
The capability of energy absorption depends on impact velocities.
"In addition, definite crush behavior of this prototype is able to accurately assess an injury level under AIS 3+."
"For this reason, the first prototype of male chest dummy is particularly suitable for an assessment of a lower serious injury level in a motorcycle crash test."
The objective of this research is to find a model for forecasting repair costs of refurbish equipment with the technique of Multiple Regression Model.
The problem is the open-front freezers have more number of repair reports higher than all types of equipment and also has a long service life.
Resulting in a large number of open-front freezers that needs to be refurbished.
"Due to the equipment is not being used, therefore, the research team is interested in finding a model for forecasting the repair cost of the equipment using the multiple linear regression model and examination of the agreement of the multiple regression model."
"Along with checking all the terms of the multiple linear regression model brought to the regression equation consisting of 3 independent variables that are related to the repair cost at the significant level of 0.05 are the number of times repaired, the purchase price of the equipment, and the service life."
The estimated regression equation is Repair = -57 + 425.1Numofrepair + 0.00804.
"Price + 1285.21Lifetime with the adjusted decision coefficient ( ) equal to 83% and the percentage of absolute average error (MAPE) of the model equation, repair forecast value is 25.54%"
This research is aimed to solve the location routing problem in the case study of ethanol plant location and raw material routing in northeastern of Thailand by design new heuristics methods.
The objective is to minimize the total transportation distance.
We collected related data to formulate mathematical model which was solved by Lingo program.
"Lingo program could find the solution for only small problem, but it could not find for large problem such as the case study."
The three heuristics methods were applied to find the solution: 1) Cluster First-Route Second- Distance (CFRSD) 2) Cluster First-Route Second- Quantity (CFRSQ) 3) Roulette Wheel and Nearest Insertion (RWANI).
The results shown that all three methods could find the solution for case study problem but RWANI method was the best performance.

"In term of number of vehicles, RWANI method generated better result than CFRSD and CFRSQ of 2.36% and 10.79% respectively."
This research studied a staff shuttle routing of the electronic components production company for car and motorcycle in Chonburi province.
The sample size of this research was 237 employees.
"Overall distance for travelling to work was 10,191 kilometers approximately."
"As a result, the carbon footprint to occur was 1,059.864 kilogram/person-kilometer."
"The objectives of this research were (1) for a staff shuttle routing which is company welfare, (2) to reduce the use of private cars which can affect traffic problems and pollutions decreasing."
The responsibility areas in this research were divided into 12 districts also to define the appropriate staff shuttle size with the servicer volume.
"After that, the travelling salesman problem was used for the appropriate staff shuttle routing."
"However, demarcation areas of responsibility made an easier solution due to the size of the problems had decreased."
"As a result, the problems can be solved with Excel Premium Solver."
"The results of this research were the total distance of all route was 1,209.56 kilometers, and a carbon footprint had decreased 21.041% per route."
"The performance of air-cooled heat exchangers in the condensate residue production of petrochemical plants had been reduced, resulting in not being able to reduce the temperature of the condensate residue as specified."
"Therefore, water mist systems had been applied to heat exchangers to help increase heat exchange performance."
The hypothesis of the research was then the water mist system could reduce the inlet air temperature of the heat exchanger and make it able to handle more heating loads.
The experiment to find the optimum conditions of the water mist system was conducted.
"There were factors of interest; 1) the water pressure of the water mist system 2) the air pressure of the water mist system, and 3) the amount of water mist nozzles."
"The results showed that the optimum condition was as follows: water pressure of the water mist system of 6 bars, air pressure of the water system of 2 bars and 16 spray nozzles."
"Then the inlet temperature of the air-cooled heat exchanger could be reduced in the range of 2.31 to 2.41 OC with a 95% confidence level and consequently, the heat exchange performance increased to 129.91 kW or 3.84%."
"When applying this condition in the production process model, the yield of the production process increased from 84 to 87 tons/hour, therefore, increased 3.45%."
"This research explored the iron ore deposit found in Uttaradit province such as Nampee, Baan Kao Lek and Baan Pang Woon."
"The chemical analysis showed that the percentage of iron in the iron ores from Nampee, Baan Kao Lek and Baan Pang Woon were 68.40, 67.01 and 57.24 respectively."
All of the iron ores found were in form of Hematite.
"In this study, the iron ores were processed, smelted by a smelter with the combination of ancient and modern skills."
"The smelted irons were forged into bars with quantities of 1,300 grams of Nampee iron, 773 grams of Baan Kao Lek iron and 873 grams of Baan Pang Woon iron."
The chemical analysis after smelting showed that Nampee iron consisted of 0.675%Cu and 3.19%W.
Baan Pang Woon iron consisted of 1.8%C and 0.130%Mn.
Baan Kao Lek iron consisted of 96.47%Fe.
The iron ore from these deposits could be forged with comparable qualities with the modem steel.
In comparing repetitive construction operations with different work programs between 1) ones with a program analyzed by network scheduling techniques i.e.
CPM and 2) ones with a program analyzed by repetitive project scheduling i.e.
"Repetitive Scheduling Method (RSM), it is obvious that the later operation has a key advantage of work crew continuity."
"Besides, according to the result of part I, this particular pattern of operation is versatile enough to sustain the changes and variations of activity durations."
"However, in many cases, work schedules by using RSM tend to have longer project durations."
This paper presents the applications of two techniques to reduce project durations as well as to enhance work performance for construction operations with RSM schedules.
The first technique is to relax the constraint of work crew continuity by splitting activity (s) with high production rates into two or more intervals with designated gaps between them so that this particular activity (s) as well as its successors can have early schedules.
The later technique is using multiple working crews on activity (s) with low production rates to shorten working duration as well as to allow their successors to start the work early.
"Given the data collected from field, the construction of 40 blocks of townhome was simulated in two scenarios, as-planned operation and actual work conditions."
The result shows that the two techniques can effectively shorten project durations as well as average throughput times in both scenarios.
"In addition, under actual work conditions, even though using more working teams can significantly reduce the total idle time and work disruption, the result is opposite on the scenario with splitting activities."
The objective of this study is to determine the effect of cyclic loading under pre-peak condition on shearing behavior of fractures in Phra Wihan sandstone.
The fractures are artificially made in the laboratory by tension inducing method.
"Specimens are sheared cyclically under forward and fully backward loading paths with constant normal stresses of 1, 2, 3 and 4 MPa."
Two cyclic loading conditions are performed on separate sets of specimens: constant stress amplitude and constant displacement amplitude.
A total of 50 shear cycles are applied for both conditions.
The results indicate that the pre-peak cyclic loading can slightly reduce shear strengths and stiffness of the sandstone fractures.
The cyclic loading under both conditions can degrade the second order asperities of the fractures.
"The energy required to shear the fractures increases with loading cycles for constant stress amplitude testing, but decreases for constant displacement amplitude testing."
The monotonic shear tests conducted after cyclic loading show the fracture peak shear strengths that are slightly lower than those of the identical fractures without cyclic loading.
Mechanical properties of consolidated crushed salt mixed with 5% MgCl2 brine by weight are determined under different stresses and periods.
The crushed salt specimens with particle sizes ranging from 0.075 to 4.76 mm are consolidated under stresses ranging from 2.5 to 10 MPa for 7 to 90 days.
The consolidations strains increase rapidly within the first 7 days and tend to approach a limit value after 30 days.
"The density, uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus measured after consolidation increase with the applied stress and duration."
The Poisson’s ratio decreases slowly with time.
"The mechanisms that strengthen and stiffen the crushed salt mass are consolidation by volumetric change due to particle rearrangement and cracking, and healing between crushed salt particles."
The mean strain energy required during consolidation for each specimen is calculated.
The relations can be used to predict the crushed salt performance installed in potash (carnallite) mine openings.
"Compaction, direct shear and compression tests have been performed to determine mechanical properties of compacted bentonite-aggregate mixtures with saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) brines for use as backfill materials in salt and potash mine openings."
"The aggregates include sludge, sand, crushed salt and gravels."
Their grain sizes range from 0.425 to 6 mm.
The mixing ratios of the bentonite-aggregate mixtures are from 30:70 to 100:0 by weight.
"The results indicate the decease of the bentonite weight ratio can increase the dry density and decease the optimum brine content, which holds true for both mixing fluids."
The cohesions and friction angles increase with increasing aggregate contents and angularity.
The compressive strengths and elastic moduli of the mixtures containing finer particles are higher than those with coarser ones.
They also increase with the bentonite weight ratio.
"Higher bentonite contents allow larger dilation of the mixtures under loading, and hence reflecting as higher Poisson’s ratio."
The specimens mixed with NaCl brine show dry densities and shear strengths similar to those mixed with MgCl2 brine.
The results can be used as initial installation parameters and material selection of backfills emplaced in salt and potash mine openings.
Void under concrete pavement is a major problem that results in damaging of concrete pavements.
Detecting such a void is quite difficult because the void is normally located under the pavement and it will not be able to be observed without any signs on the pavement surface.
This study investigated the capabilities of ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique for void detection.
The main objective was to determine the appropriate data acquisitions and visualization techniques of GPR data to provide a better image of survey results.
"In this study, the GPR data were acquired using both 400 and 900 MHz frequency antennas."
"Then, all 2D profiles were combined to create a 3D GPR model."
"Additionally, the GPR data were also converted into the frequency, phase, and amplitude domain using Hilbert transform."
"From the results of this study, the image obtained from the 900 MHz frequency antenna provided better resolution while the data from the 400 MHz frequency antenna gave a greater depth of penetration, but its resolution was less than 900 MHz."
"For 2D profile, it is good for viewing the shape and depth of the voids."
"In contrast, the 3D image makes it possible to see the boundary of the voids from the top view."
The results also concluded that time domain GPR data provided clearer shape and depth of the voids.
"However, the data from Hilbert transform gave the better position of voids."
Developing a city or a wide area in the economic will result in an increase in the number of vehicles - especially the enter in and exit out at the city.
"This is one of the most important problems that will affect road traffic, causing traffic congestion."
The main approach is to increase promote the usage of the mass transit system.
"However, reducing traffic congestion on major roadway coordinate is also very important as well."
Improving the intersection operation to accommodate increased usage and increasing the coordination system of the system is an accepted solution.
"In this research work, a traffic signal coordination study is conducted to improve a traffic flow condition and to reduce the number of stops on the main roadway."
A case study of The Royal Initiate Project Road of His Majesty King Rama IX (Pra Ratchadumri Road) between Pra Ratchadumri Road – Phet Uthai Road – Si Rat Expressway Intersection and Piyavate Hospital Intersection.
Synchro – a traffic signal coordination simulation software is used to experiment and test for this technique.
A result of this study shows that applying the traffic signal coordination technique does help improve traffic flow conditions and reduce vehicle stops on this main corridor.
"This paper aims to use sludge, waste material, from the electricity production process for local community benefits."
The chemical properties of sludge from power plant was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF).
"The result show that the sludge comprises high amounts of SiO2 and Al2O3 as pozzolanic materials, mixed with fly ash and Portland cement to enhance strength of interlocking brick block."
"From 9 ratios of mixing tested in this study, the optimal ratio is a ratio of sludge: fly ash: Portland cement at 50: 50: 10 and the optimal concrete curing time is 28 days."
The maximum compressive strength was 27.75 kilogram per square centimeter (ksc) and the water absorption value is lower than 14%.
The interlocking brick block made from sludge was passed the criteria of Thai Industrial Standard (TIS) and suitable for use as non load bearing construction materials.
The blocks sized 10 x 20 x 10 cm.
were made from optimal ratio of sludge with the construct cost less than 10 Baht/piece.
The blocks were used for construction materials in 3 landmark areas of the community nearby power plant and were received good cooperation and feedback.
"In present, most pagodas are constructed using reinforced concrete."
"However, studies on the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete pagodas remain limited."
Most study reports on the dynamics behavior of pagodas are of masonry pagodas and timber pagodas which have been constructed since ancient times.
This research aims to study the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete pagodas using a direct measurement method and the use of a finite element model.
The studied pagoda is the Ban Koh temple pagoda located in Udon Thani province.
The pagoda is Lanka bell shape with height of about 72 meters.
"The structure of the pagoda is a system of reinforced concrete columns, beams, slabs and walls."
"As a result from the direct measurement under ambient vibration using accelerometers, the dynamic properties of the pagoda including the first mode natural vibration frequency, natural vibration mode shape of the first mode and damping ratio were obtained and used for calibration of model parameter of the finite element model."
The finite element model was then adopted for further study on the dynamic behavior of the pagoda.
"From the study results, a better understanding on the dynamic behavior of the reinforced concrete pagoda was obtained and a guideline for modeling of the reinforced concrete pagoda was suggested."
This paper presents a design procedure to determine the thickness of granular layer of ballasted railroad track based on the engineering performance of subgrade soil.
The present procedure is a modification of Li and Selig method and is developed particularly for meter-gauge railroad tracks.
It reflects and models two key aspects of the mechanical track response: 1) development of permanent or plastic strains of the subgrade soil subject to accumulated traffic loads and 2) stress-distribution characteristics in the track structure.
"A realistic three-dimensional model of railroad track based on elasticity theory is employed to analyze the stresses, while the accumulation of plastic strain of the subgrade soil is modeled by a power function."
"The modeling results, when combined together, render a robust method to determine granular layer thickness that is sufficient to prevent excessive deformations and subsequent failure of the subgrade."
Design charts based on the present methodology and suitable for the typical service conditions for railroad tracks in Thailand are introduced and provided.
"This research was to study the mixture ratio of lightweight interlocking blocks from sludge mixed with 3 types of pozzolanic materials such as bagasse ash, diatomite, and rice husk ash by calculating the cement mixture ratio with sludge replacement percentages of 20-80 by weight of cement when obtaining the appropriate mixture ratio with respect to compressive strength that passed the standard and lightweight before replacing the sample with 3 types of pozzolanic materials at 10 % sludge by weight for determines the mixture ratio of lightweight interlocking blocks ."
"Based on the study results, the sludge replacement caused a decrease in compressive strength for all ratios."
"In this research, the cement-sludge mixture ratio of 30:70 was, therefore, chosen to replace 3 types of pozzolanic materials."
"According to replacement results, it showed that the replacement by bagasse ash yielded higher compressive strengths than control samples for all ratios, where as the replacement by diatomite and rice husk ash yielded a decrease in compressive strength when compared to control samples."
"Regarding weight, replacement by 3 types of pozzolanic materials resulted in lightweight for all ratios."
"As for testing of masonry prisms, it demonstrated that replacement by bagasse ash in the cement-sludge- bagasse ash ratio of 30:40:40 yielded the maximum compressive strength when compared to interlocking blocks from 3 markets, corresponding to the standard of the non-load-bearing interlocking block that determines the compressive strength not less than 70 ksc."
Nowadays engineers and architects utilized various polymeric coating fabrics extensively for architectural works.
"For design and application of fabric, the heat transfer coefficient play an important role as a key factor."
The heat transfer coefficient of the fabrics cannot be measured directly by the standard equipment due to the following reasons: 1) fabric thinness 2) being a composite material and 3) being an imporous material.
"Therefore, the researcher follows the standard ASTM C518 as a guideline for inventing the heat generating equipment."
"This equipment consists of heating plate, cooling plate, temperature control system, heating flux sensors, temperature sensors, architecture fabric, and data logger."
The equipment is designed in a way that all parts can be assembled and dissembled easily.
The architectural fabrics made from polyester (PES) polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with known heat transfer coefficients are used for calibrating the equipment with the average error of 1.60%.
"Thus, this equipment works effectively and deliver precise measurement of heat transfer coefficient."
The result shows that the values of heat transfer coefficients ranges from 0.043 to 0.058 W/m.K.
The linear equation is 0.1543x + 0.0029 where the indepentdent variable x is the thickness of the architecture fabric (0.08 to 0.18 mm).
"In the past, it was found that the establishment of a waste-to-energy power plant was not accepted by the community, both in terms of municipal solid waste management as energy and energy production technology of the power plant."
This research therefore used an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a research tool.
The results of this research will be useful for planning the establishment of a power plant that has been accepted by the community.
"The community that would be a case study was located in Sri Prachan district, Suphanburi province with 16,500 tons of community waste per year."
"In conducting the research, data were collected from the opinions of 24 experts and 21 community representatives' opinions."
The analysis was divided into two issues.
The first issue was the analysis of the waste management as energy.
"The main criteria of analysis include political (P), economy (Ec), society (S), technology (T), environment (En) and legal (L)."
The second issue was the analysis of energy production technology of the waste to energy plant.
"The main criteria were types of waste (W), investments (I), energy from production processes (E), and technology acceptance (A)."
The results showed that both experts and community representatives agreed that separating the waste before producing energy and should have a capacity of less than 10 MW of electricity.
"In energy production technology issue, the experts chose the gasification technology while the community representative chose the technology of incinerator."
Their opinions were different.
"From the observations, it was found that the community representatives had more experience in producing energy from the incinerator than others."
Suggestions should allow the community to have experience in other energy production technologies and received recognition from the community before the establishment of the waste-to-energy plant.

The adsorbent from this work could adsorb Pb(II) which shound be of interest in application such as wastewater treatment.
This research studied effect of natural fibers from deposal materials on mechanical properties of cement fiber ceiling boards to explore an appropriate mixture.
Natural fibers from paper tissues and oil palm fibers were used as an aggregate mixed with Portland cement type 1.
"The percentages of paper tissues (P) ranged 25-35, oil palm fiber (F) were 0 and 1 and water cement ratio (W) ranged 0.8-1.4 in total 10 mixtures."
"The specimens were then proved by testing of compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, thermal property and sound absorption."
"It was found that an increase in the percentage of paper tissues had a direct consequence in decreasing of compressive strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity."
"Though, increasing of oil palm fibers showed effect on thermal property."
"Therefore, there was no remarkable impact on sound absorption."
"In thermal properties aspect, the suitable mixture was P25F1W90 because it yielded the highest efficiency ventilation."
These ceiling boards not only help to reduce energy consumption in buildings but also can be a choice to make effective use of waste materials that can be an alternative for low-cost construction.

This research presents an experimental investigation of shear strengthening of pretension concrete beams with large circular openings by CFRP.
A total of 4 prestressed concrete beams with and without openings were constructed and tested under center-point loading.
Test specimen had a cross section of 0.18x0.40 m. and a span length of 3.80 m. Three beams with circular opening had a ratio of   .
Experimental results showed that beam with circular opening failed by shear at the lower load capacity of 36.27% compared to the control beam.
The externally shear strengthening using CFRP in prestressed concrete beams with large opening in normally strengthening beam and in shear failure-strengthening beam had effectively increased the load capacity of 47.68% and 48.22% compared to the unstrengthened beam respectively.
The mode of failure of both strengthened beams were switched from shear failure to flexural failure.
Moreover this research proposes the equation for predicting shear strength in prestressed concrete beam with large opening having the accuracy not exceed than 3%
Repetitive construction such as housing development projects can be scheduled by various methods including Critical Path Method (CPM) and Repetitive Scheduling Method (RSM).
This paper presents the effects of using different work schedules between CPM and RSM by using STROBOSCOPE to simulate the construction of 40 housing units based on the data from a real construction project.
The result shows that different scheduling criteria result in different activity schedules and critical activities.
"Given the first scenario which work is performed as planned, CPM schedule has shorter project duration with less average throughput time compared to those of RSM."
"However, with unbalanced activity production rates, CPM schedule results in work discontinuity leading to high value of total worker idle time, while RSM schedule results no idle time at all."
The second scenario is actual work condition.
Activity durations are input in the form of density functions based on data collected from field.
The result shows that the variations of activities’ durations have high impacts on CPM in all aspects.
"Project duration, average throughput time, and total worker idle time become double."
"However, these particular work conditions have slight impacts on RSM."
"This is because, to promote work continuity, the start dates of many activities are delayed, and this creates gaps between two adjacent activities."
These gaps turn into time buffers which will alleviate adversity of delay to the successors.
"In the last scenario, controllable causes of disruption are assumed to be diminished."
"The results of this scenario are relatively similar to those of the first scenario as, in this case study, most of obstacles are avoidable."
The irrigation structures in Songphinong operation and maintenance project are at the age between 28-32 years old.
These are reinforced concrete structures.
The deterioration of several structures are effected by many factors.
"In this research, visual inspection was conducted to evaluate the concrete deterioration of 32 irrigation structures."
"In addition, the soil samples were collected at the position adjacent to these structures and concrete powder from 5 large irrigation structures in the project area."
All samples were tested at Soil Science Laboratory of Kasetsart University and Central Laboratory of Kasetsart University.
The results reveal that structures of 53.6 percent have the level of the moderate damage in class 3 with some of structures have crack parallel to reinforcing steel and need for more examine in details.
"While the results of soil and concrete chemical testing, the most of soil in the area have amount of sulfate between 0.0004-0.084 percent by weight which less than minimum value of allowable sulfate, the amount of chloride in soil between 0-0.04 percent by weight off concert."
"From results of testing concrete, there were found that sulfate in concrete of irrigation structures have between 0.53-1.90 percent by weight which were higher than the minimum value of allowable sulfate for severe condition."
Moreover amount of chloride higher results more than maximum value of allowable chloride.
It may affect the service life of the structures in future.
Seawater intrusion can gradually cause a severe problem by contaminating freshwater aquifers and causing a lack of fresh water.
The main purpose of this study was to assess the seawater intrusion problem in the coastal area of Phuket.
"To map the seawater intrusion, an analysis of existing groundwater chemistry data (2003-2016), obtained from groundwater producing wells and monitoring wells, was carried out."
Chloride (Cl) concentration and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) were the two main indicators of seawater intrusion.
"The average Cl concentration and TDS are highly correlated in a cross-plot in 8 sub-districts (Chalong, Rawai, Karon, Kamala, Mai Khao, Choeng Thale, Sisunthon and Thep Krasattri) of Phuket, and the risk areas with seawater intrusion problem were identified by these levels exceeding threshold (600 and 1,500 mg.L-1 for Cl concentration and TDS, respectively)."
"A map of Phuket seawater intrusion was created by GIS techniques, by overlaying the based maps for Cl, TDS, groundwater extraction, and transmissivity."
"The map indicates that the coastal area in the northern part (Mai-Khao) have serious seawater intrusion, while the coastal areas of Kamala, Rawai, and Chalong, close to the middle and the southern part have only moderate seawater intrusion."
Methodologies and computer programs exist to simulate complex industrial production and construction processes.
"For the former, Arena software provides acceptable simulation results, but has not yet been applied to clearly simulate construction processes."
Construction processes have often been simulated by the COSMOS simulator.
Construction process simulation between the Arena and COSMOS simulator programs has yet to be done.
"In this research, Arena was used to simulate two construction processes and compared to COSMOS’s simulation of the same situations."
Results were that both programs provided consistent simulations.
"Arena simulated construction processes closely, and COSMOS accurately compared to Arena’s findings."
"Modelling methodologies of the programs were also juxtaposed, to reveal differences and precision of construction process simulation."

The data were collected from January to April 2018.
"The results showed that the allowance rate per month that the sample group, which consist of 121 engineers, required was 10,000-300,000 Baht per month, with the mode of 30,000 Baht per month, the median of 50,000 Baht per month and an average of 59,446 Baht per month."
"The result from the median test by means of the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that the differences in marital status, household salaries, expenses, business industry, and education fields, had significant impacts on Thai engineers’ requirements for the allowance."
"The utility of benefits estimated by means of Conjoint Analysis revealed the following significant incentives for engineers:  earning an extra allowance of 30,000 Baht per month, earning an extra salary of 5,000 Baht, having health insurance and accident insurance abroad, changing from a 30 square meter room with a roommate to a 60 square meter room without a roommate with a housemaid, and having additional 10 days of leave per year, respectively."
This research was fabricated low thermal conductivity walkway block from waste foam residue which activated by organic solvent and heat treatment process.
"The effect of various ratios of organic solvent such as soybean oil to waste foam residue at the level of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 were investigated."
These walkway blocks were compared with the other from cement paste at water to cement ratio of 0.5.
"All specimens at the age of 3 days were tested for compressive and flexural strength, unit weight, water absorption, and thermal conductivity."
The test results showed that the decreasing of soybean oil to waste foam residue ratio resulted in the reducing of unit weight and thermal conductivity while increasing of compressive and flexural strength values.
"Moreover, the compressive and flexural strength values of the walkway blocks form waste foam residue were higher than that of the walkway blocks form cement paste while the unit weight, water absorption, and thermal conductivity values were lower than that of the other."
The synthesized walkway blocks had better mechanical properties and thermal conductivity values than that of commercial block which passed the standard set by Thai Industrial Standard (TIS 378-2531) for concrete flooring tiles.
"In addition, these walkway blocks form waste foam residue can be used as thermal insulation flooring tile which suited for in-outdoor area of the buildings."

This paper determines an inventory policy for semi-finished products in a case study of enamel paint production.
The semi-finished products include pigment pastes.
They are main components which are commonly used during tinting process to adjust the quality of color.
Shortages of pigment pastes can interrupt the production process.
"In order to prevent the inventory shortages, this research proposes a method to systematically determine the pigment paste inventory policy."
"The proposed inventory policy suggests a periodic review system with reorder point and fixed order quantity policy or (R, s, Q) inventory model with cycle service level 99% while keeping the average inventory less than or equal to the current practice."
This inventory policy is constructed under production constraints as well as stochastic demand and lead time.
The proposed policy is tested with simulation model by comparing the results from the proposed policy with the current practice.
The results show that the cycle service level for all items has improved to meet the target level of 99% which implies the shortage reduction.
"In addition, average inventory level and the number of setups can be reduced by approximately 48% and 47%, respectively."

The specific area of the ashes affected the adsorption capacities.
This paper computationally investigated behavior of metal sheet confined concrete specimens subjected to axial compression.
"To understand mechanisms that occurred in the metal sheet confinement system during the loading, plain concrete specimens confined with 1-3 layers of metal sheet were analyzed via the three dimensional finite element analysis."
Cylindrical and square cuboid concrete specimens of the same cross sectional area were selected to understand effect of specimen shapes on axial compression behavior of metal sheet confined specimens.
The numerical results showed that the metal sheet confinement system could improve axial compression capacity of all the specimens.
"The improved stress-strain behavior of the specimens was not influenced by lateral confinement only, but also by ability of metal sheet in resisting axial compression."
It was observed that shape and number of layers of confinement affected the strength increase.
"For two layers of metal sheet application, slightly different behaviors were found at the inner and the outer jackets."
"For the cuboid specimen, different behaviors at the region near the corner and on the side were noticed."
"The non-uniform stress distribution across the square section led to lower axial strength improvement when applying the same number of metal sheet layers, as compared to the circular section."
"Nowadays, there is a great increase in underground constructions."
"Therefore, it is necessary to develop the construction technique to increase efficiency of soil retaining structure."
Movement of soil protection system can be decreased by many ways.

"The objective of this study is to collect hydraulic data and river temperature data to analyse the behaviour of the warm water distribution in the lower Chao Phraya River, influenced by the rise and fall of sea level."
"There were nine field trips to collect data, of 24 hours/trip, covering the rainy season, the winter, and the summer."
"The results show that the influences on water temperature are sunlight, flow velocity, water depth, and source of warm water."
"In the cases of the high and moderate discharge seasons, during periods of lowering water levels approaching the lowest level, and just after the lowest level has passed, the water surface has a high slope."
"When the flow in the Chao Phraya River exceeds 2,000 cubic meters per second, the fresh water flows into the sea with a high velocity."
The mixing process takes place quickly within the appropriate water depth.
Vertical temperature transfers between the flow layers is very efficient.
"It allows the warm water mass at the water surface, which is warmed by sunlight, to mix well with cooler water in deeper layers."
"Considering the case of a neap tide, the sea level does not rise and fall much."
"Therefore, the vertical distribution of water temperature has a slightly narrower range compared to during a spring tide."
"Considering cases of warm water discharge from a source, stream velocity and appropriate water depth help warm water to mix with cooler water within a limited space from the river bank, only about 40% of the width of the river."
This research studied the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of the interlocking block containing biomass ash.
"Portland cement to sandy soil and to laterite soil ratio of 1: 5.8: 1.6 with the replacement levels of sandy soil with biomass ash of 0, 20, 40 and 60 % by weight of sandy soil were used in this study."
"The specimens at the age of 28 days were tested for compressive strength, unit weight, water absorption and thermal conductivity."
"The test results showed that the increasing of biomass ash resulted in the decreasing of compressive strength, unit weight, and thermal conductivity and the increasing of water absorption."
All of these specimens passed the standard requirement as per Thai Industrial Standard 602/2547 for non-load bearing type of interlocking block and thus can be used as the commercial interlocking block.
"Moreover, these interlocking blocks had low thermal conductivity values which are suitable for use as the internal wall for the building insulation."
This paper presents the bond behavior between concrete and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates.
"The studied behavior includes the bond strength, effective bond length, bond stress-slip relationship, and failure mode."
A single shear pushing test method was conducted.
"The concrete prisms (150×150×500 mm) were adhesively bonded with CFRP plates of different bond lengths (100,200,300, and 400 mm)."
The results showed that the debonding failure occurred at concrete substrate.
The effective bond length could reasonably be predicted by Fib14 equation.
"Also, the ACI 440.2R equation for debonding strain of FRP plates predict higher values than the test data."
"Based on the test data, different models for constructing the bond stress-slip relationships were assessed."
The interfacial fracture energy values obtained from Popovic and bi-linear models were found to be similar and higher than ones obtained from Dai et al.
(2005) method.
This article aims to produce the dissimilar metals butt joint between AISI1015 carbon steel and AISI304 stainless steel using a shielded metal arc welding.
"Welding process parameter in this study was a welding current of 80-120 A and a welding electrode of E307, E309 and E312."
The summarized results are as follows.
The butt joint of AISI1015 carbon steel and AISI304 stainless steel could be successfully produced using SMAW process.
Optimized welding parameter that suggested highest impact strength was the welding current of 100 ฤ and the welding electrode of E312.
Micro-hardness examination results showed the highest hardness at the weld metal because of the formation of the dendrite structure and carbide phase in the fusion area.
Absorbed energy of the joint was higher when the joint was welded by the electrode that contained higher chromium and carbon.
"Dendrite structure in the weld metal that large, short and uniform, affected directly to increase the joint impact strength."
"Nowadays, the demand of electrical machines is increasing rapidly."
Relay and switch are the important parts of electronic equipment.
Improving the production capacity of electronic components is necessary to accommodate the fast-growing demand of relay and switch and to meet the needs of customers.
The objectives of this study were to improve the production capacity of the electronic components of the relay and switch.
Fish bone diagram was used to find the influencing factors of the production capacity.
We found that the using speed of machine below the machine capacity is the main factor of the problem.
"After improved the production capacity by increasing the speed of machine, the production capacity of the part of relay and switch increases up to 66.67 percent and the number of working days to be completed within a period reduces to 40.00 percent."
Corbel is a structural member which is generally used in building construction especially in precast systems.
Reactive powder concrete (RPC) is a new type of ultra-high strength concrete having high mechanical properties and durability and no design standard.
This research aims to study the behavior of RPC corbels without stirrups under increasing vertical loading until failure.
The shear span-to-depth ratio (av/d) of the corbels was 1.0.
"From the test results, it was found that the load carrying capacity of the RPC corbels exhibit ductile behavior."
No sudden failure occurred even though the corbels had no stirrups.
"In addition, the failure characteristics of the corbels and the analysis of the test results using strut-and-tie model are also reported in this paper."
"Among all construction methods, precast construction has gained its popularity over the past 50 years due to the realized benefits."
"However, it is surprising that the uptake of precast construction method is still in its infancy in Cambodia."
"Thus, the goal of the research aims to investigate the factors impacting precast utilization in Cambodia construction industry by evaluating the significance of 5 benefits and 25 hindrances obtained from extensive literature reviews which impact the practitioner’s perspectives via a closed-ended questionnaire of four different groups such as designers, manufacturers, deliverers, and assemblers."
"Consequently, this applied cross-sectional quantitative research found out top five significant factors in four main processes such as design, production, transportation and delivery of precast technology in Cambodia construction industry."
"Since 1997, the housing market in Thailand has continued to grow, particularly in Bangkok and its vicinities."
"The highest number of residential ownership transfers over the past 18 years has been found, resulting in problems with the increased transfer of ownership, as well as accelerated construction."
"As a result, complaints to the Office of the Consumer Protection Board (OCPB) increased steadily since 2011, ranking the first for 4 consecutive years."
"In the year of 2015, condominium was ranked No."
"1 for the most complaints about property, with the number of 1,163 cases found."
"The most complaint issues were about the incomplete construction works, defects after construction, and low-quality finishes."
"Therefore, this research aims at the prioritization of critical factors in after-sales service of condominium unit repairing within warranty period in Bangkok and its vicinities."
Data collection was carried out by means of questionnaire distributed to 314 respondents in 7 projects.
The achieved data were analyzed for the mean ( ) whereas degree of importance was assessed by Modified Priority Needs Index (PNImodified) from the total 60 factors.

This paper presents the deflection behavior of reinforced concrete slab strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates to increase service load.
The tested specimens represent the reinforced concrete flat slab which always have problem with large deflection after long term use.
CFRP strengthening was the famous technique for solving this problem.
Four slab specimens without and with CFRP plates were tested in order to investigate the ability of slab deflection reduction.
The tested result show that the strengthening method by CFRP plate can significantly reduce the slab deflection.
"The deflection was reduced about 38 and 50 percent for slab strengthened with 1 CFRP plate and 2 CFRP plates, respectively."
"Furthermore, the equation of the effective moment of inertia from ACI440.1R-06 considering CFRP section in the calculation of moment inertia of crack section has been applied to predict the deflection of slab strengthened with CFRP plate."
It was found that the given effective moment of inertia can be used to predict the slab deflection very well compared to the experimental results.
This paper presents a branch and bound algorithm for the solution of the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem with Return.
The algorithm is composed of three main steps.
"In the first step, branching divides the problem into smaller subproblems that are easier and quicker to handle."
All possible solutions are then checked for feasibility by comparing with the boundaries (lower and upper bounds).
"The second step, known as bounding, is to find lower and upper bounds for the solution at each node that are continually refined over time."
A feasible solution must lie between these bounds.
"In the third step, called node selection, the jump-tracking strategy chooses a node with the best result to process."
"For obtaining the optimal solution, many iterations are executed until the shortest route is identified."
"A computer program was developed based on the algorithm, and number of test cases have been solved in an acceptable time; a 15 city problem took less than a second, and a 800 city problem required about 30 minutes."
"An anaerobic wastewater treatment pond of palm oil extraction plant is a source of hydrogen sulfide gas, that may spread and cause trouble to nearby residents."
The objective of this research was to analyze the location of the wastewater treatment pond of the palm oil extraction plant in Chumphon province with a capacity of 360 tons of fresh palm per day.
This research was conducted using ALOHA program to analyze the radius of dispersion of hydrogen sulfide gas.
"The result stated the radius of dispersion of gas at the level of the general public (AEGL-1) as follows: (1) the wind from the north had a distance along the wind direction of 3.4 km, with a perpendicular to the wind direction of 0.32km., (2) the wind from the west, a distance was 1.8 km, with a perpendicular to the wind direction of 0.29 km., and (3) the wind from the east, a distance was 1.4 km, with a perpendicular to the wind direction of 0.32 km."
"However, considering the minimal impact on the community, the pond should not be located in the north of the nearby residents for less than 3.4 km."
"Likewise, the radius of dispersion should be determined again for a different capacity, and the pond should not locate in the north of the nearby residents for less than the radius of dispersion as well."
The objective of this study is to examine the mechanical properties of sandstone under subzero temperature.
This sandstone belongs to the Phra Wihan formation which is commonly found in the northeast of Thailand.
"The cylindrical shaped specimens with diameter of 54 mm are prepared by cutting machine to obtain the specified length and ratios (L/D = 0.5 for Brazilian tension test, L/D = 2.5 for uniaxial compression test and L/D = 2.0 for triaxial compression test)."
The tests are performed on dry and saturated rock samples under the temperature varying from 25 to -40°C.
The cubical rock samples with nominal dimensions of 26´26´26 mm3 are also prepared to be investigated the effect of water expansion in pore spaces during freezing-thawing cycle.
The results indicated that the tensile and compressive strength under dry and saturated conditions slightly increased (ranging from 60.9 to 184.1 MPa for compressive strength and 5.3 to 9.0 MPa for tensile strength) with decreasing of temperatures (between 25 and -40°C).
This is due to the fact that the specimens under low temperature have a lower thermal energy than those under high temperature.
This allows the rock sample to absorb more mechanical energy and to develop higher stresses before the failure occurs.
The effect of temperature on strength under saturated conditions is considerably greater than that under dry condition.
"After the temperature below -5°C, the increasing rate of tensile and compressive strength tend to get high as temperature decreases."
This is because the strength of ice in pore space becomes high.
"The strength parameters, cohesion (c) and internal friction angle (f) based on Coulomb criterion, slightly increase with decreased temperatures."
The “m” constant based on Hoek and Brown criterion decreases with decreasing temperature.
"Under saturated condition, the adhesive force between ice and grain of sandstone can strengthen the rock strength."
The temperature has a significantly effect on elasticity of saturated rock specimens when it was below freezing temperature.
The strength parameters determined from the test results of dry and saturated rock samples under subzero temperatures can be applied to determine the mechanical stability of the rock mass during the excavation with ground freezing techniques.
"Constant head flow test has been performed on twenty-four cylindrical rock specimens obtained from Phu Phan and Sao Khua formations, representing ones of the aquifers in northeast of Thailand."
The specimens are prepared with nominal diameters of 54 mm and length-to-diameter ratio of 1.5.
The flow direction is normal and parallel to bedding planes.
The test procedure is in accordance with the ASTM standard practice.
The permeability of Sao Khua sandstone is lower than that of Phu Phan sandstone.
It decreases with increasing confining pressures.
The flow rates in the direction normal to the bedding planes are lower than those parallel to the bedding planes.
The permeability anisotropy tends to be independent of the confining pressure.
"It is about 10 for Phu Phan sandstone, and 12 for Sao Khua sandstone."
"The effective porosity of Phu Phan sandstone is higher than that of Sao Khua sandstone, particularly under high confining pressures."
They range from 4.5% to 7.3% for Phu Phan sandstone and 1.9% to 4.3% for Sao Khua sandstone.
Long-term healing test under constant hydrostatic stresses (3-20 MPa) has been performed to assess the healing effectiveness of tension-induced fractures in rock salt and potash specimens.
Gas flow testing has been conducted to monitor the changes of fracture permeability under constant stresses for up to 21 days.
Line-loading on the healed fractures has been performed to assess the healing effectiveness.
The results show that hydrostatic stresses and durations can decrease fracture permeability and increase healing effectiveness.
"Healing mechanism of rock salt fractures involves covalent bonding of cleavage planes, while that of potash fractures is related to recrystallization processes."
"The permeability and healing effectiveness of salt and potash fractures have been derived as a function of the applied mean strain energy, primarily to allow predicting their healing behavior under in-situ conditions (confining stresses)."
The findings imply that permeability of fractures at greater depths may be reduced quicker than those at shallower depths.
"Under the same mean strain energy, salt fractures can be healed better than potash fractures."
"This is because the bulk modulus of potash is much lower than that of rock salt, and hence it can absorb higher mean strain energy."
This paper investigates the shear strength characteristics of the natural rubber (NR) bonded sand.
"The sand-natural rubber (SNR) mixtures were prepared by adding five different NR contents namely 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30% by weight of dry sand."
Direct shear apparatus was employed to investigate the effect of the NR content on shear strength and dilation behavior of the SNR specimens.
"In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was conducted to observe the microscale direct interaction between sand particle and NR."
The obtained results demonstrated that the shear strength behaviors of sand become ductile materials with adding the NR content.
Result from the SEM analysis reveals that the voids between sand particles are filled by the NR which sand particles are coated and bonded together with the NR.
Degree of improvement of the stress ratio and shear strength parameter that is a function of the NR content indicated that the NR effectively improves the shear strength of sand.
"Each year, the Department of the Comptroller has circulated a list of contractors' work abandonment to all government agency, local government and state enterprises, they are not permitted to do any juristic relation with any contractors in the debarment list."
But the abandonment of the constructions are still happening a lot.
The purpose of this research is to analyze and investigate the trend of contractors’ work abandonment in public project.
"The population was the contractors who abandon the public projects 710 projects from the circular letter of The Comptroller General’s Department, Ministry of Finance 179 issues from 2012 to 2016."

The type of work that most contractors' work abandonment was road construction (57.21%).
The form of the local government that most contractors' work abandonment was Sub-district Administration Organization (55.72%).
The tendency of the work abandonment found that the juristic person had capital exceed 5 million tend to decrease clearly and subdistrict municipality tend to increase clearly.
"The hypothesis testing at the 0.05 level of significance revealed that business model of contractors' work abandonment, project value that contractors' work abandonment, type of work that contractors' work abandonment, and form of the local government that contractors' work abandonment were a different proportion, and business model of contractors' work abandonment were related with project value that contractors' work abandonment."
"Normally, free surface elevation measurements, both in the coastal field and laboratory, mostly use traditional wave gauges such as capacitance, resistance, and conductivity types."
"These types of equipment take intrusive measurements, as they disturb the wave propagation."
"This study focuses on an alternative technique, namely an image processing and analysis approach based on the canny edge detection and water elevation comparing algorithm in Matlab."
"Five experimental case studies of water surface elevation changes were carried out in a wave flume 0.60 m wide, 18 m long, and 0.75 m high."
"The results showed that the average wave heights and wave periods measured using both methods are different by not more than 9.26% and 0.49%, respectively."
"Moreover, the statistical agreement of water surface elevations in term of MSE, RMSE, and R2 confirmed that image processing is as good as the conventional method and can be used in the laboratory as well."
"The injection molding process of plastic part had been used computer-aided design (CAD) to create geometry and shape, and computer-aided engineering (CAE) to analyze the molten plastic flow inside the mold cavity."
The procedure for design and analysis of the injection plastic part had been performed using the interactive or trial and error method to improve the injection mold until the final result had been received and the injection plastic part could be produced completely.
These methods were consumed time for design and analysis.
"Otherwise, the error might be happened by the data transformation between the CAD and plastic injection analysis software."
This research applied the CAD/CAE integration method of the injection molding plastic to design and analyze plastic parts.
The different shape and physical characteristic had been carried out to study and produce.
The injecting plastic parts were used the CAD/CAE integration software to design and analyze injection for rapidly obtaining the injection part and conditions.
"After the plastic parts were produced, it was obtained the good quality and corrected dimension that the average error of 5.02 %."

This paper aims to weld a dissimilar SS400/SUS304 steel T-joint using high chromium electrode and study an effect of welding current on joint properties.
T-joints that welded by the designed welding currents were mechanically prepared and systematically investigated for joint properties.
The experimental results were summarized as follows.
Dissimilar SS400/SUS304 steels T-joint could successfully welded using a gas metal arc welding process with no defect in weld metal.
The optimized welding current in this experiment was 160 A that showed a minimized crack in a bending test of 0.247 mm.
"A different chemical composition of low carbon steel and high chromium weld metal produced a small interface that showed a smaller mixed zone of reinforced elements and base metal, and also affected to decrease the joint strength."
"However, the increase of the welding current could increase the combination of the reinforced element and the base metal at the interface and affected to increase the joint strength."
Triaxial shear tests are performed to assess the effects of water saturation and confining pressure on shear strengths and dilations of tension-induced fractures and smooth saw-cut surfaces prepared in Phra Wihan sandstone.
A polyaxial load frame is used to apply confining pressures between 1 and 18 MPa with displacement velocities ranging from 1.15×10-5 to 1.15×10-2 mm/s.
The results indicate that water saturation of the rock can reduce the peak and residual shear strengths of the fractures.
Shearing resistances of smooth saw-cut surfaces tend to be independent of the displacement velocity and water saturation.
Under each confinement the peak and residual shear strengths and dilation rates of rough fractures increase with displacement velocities.
"The sheared-off areas increase when the confining pressure increases, and the displacement rate decreases."
An empirical criterion that explicitly incorporates the effects of shear velocity is proposed to describe the peak and residual shear strengths of fractures in saturated sandstone.
"The criterion fits well to the test results, which may be used to predict the shear strengths of the saturated sandstone under in-situ condition."
The standard fire protection in buildings is regulated by the government.
The internationally used standard is the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).
The standard NFPA 20 and NFPA 25 indicated the use of fire pump in the system.
"Since the fire pump is not regularly used, therefore the pump performance may not be up to the working standard."
"In order to keep the pump to be in good condition, the NFPA required every building to perform their pumps testing periodically."
"Due to inexperience personals and lack of instrument, the fire pump testing procedure took a considerable long time to obtain the performance testing result."
This paper presented an automated fire pump performance testing system.
"A laboratory-scale system was constructed and test.The presented system shown to improve the testing time, accurate of testing result and permit the building to perform the test more frequent than required."
The objective of this research was to determine the thermal efficiency of the combined solar and biomass drying system for drying the 8 mm thickness of cassava chips.
"The passive drying system which has volume of 2x3x0.4 m3 and capacity of 50 kg of fresh cassava chips, it was operated with an inverted downdraft biomass gas stove."
The results showed that the average temperature of the combined solar and biomass drying system was 5-8oC higher than the solar dryer at all times.
"As a result, the moisture content of the cassava chips decreased from 60.5% (w.b.)"
to 14% (w.b.)
"with the least drying time of 11 h, while the solar dryer took 13 h and the solar traditional dryer took the longest 14 h. It was clearly seen that the heat from the biomass gas stove of this research increased the temperatures of the dryer and reduced drying time."
The overall thermal efficiency of this research was lowest 5.92% due to more heat loss from the heating equipment of the drying system.
"Area of mangrove forests in Thailand has considerably decreased because the mangrove forests have been destroyed to use the land for other purposes, e.g."
aquaculture.
"Even though there have been reforestation campaigns, the effectiveness of the reforestation is still very low because the rate of survival of the mangrove sprouts is very low."
"This research focuses on the effect of flooded level, which is one of the important factors influencing on the physical characteristics of mangrove sprouts."
Experiment was conducted in a big plastic tank.
"Inside the tank there were three steps for simulating the mangrove sprouts planting with two types of mangroves sprouts, Avicennia alba and Rhizophora apiculate, plated with three different flooded levels – 70, 35 and 15 cm."
"To simulate tide, every day water was pumped into the tank, then immersed the sprouts for three hours, and was finally pumped."
The experiment was continued for 67 days.
"After test, the changes of the physical characteristics of each sprout were determined."
"The results showed that at the flooded level 70 cm., the sprout grew the least."
"In addition, Avicennia alba sprouts were more durable to flooding than Rhizophora apiculate."

ABSTRACT Series of triaxial cyclic loading tests have been performed to predict the time-dependent deformation of supported pillars in abandoned salt mines planned for a compressed-air energy storage operation.
The salt specimens are prepared to obtain rectangular prisms with nominal dimensions of 54´54´108 mm.
"The applied axial and lateral cyclic stresses depend on mining depths, extraction ratios and injection pressures."
The confining pressures vary from 20% (withdrawal) to 90% (injection) of the in-situ stresses.
The stress conditions are calculated for the depths from 250 to 400 m with extraction ratios ranging from 30 to 60%.
All tests are performed up to 21 days.
Each cycle takes 24 hours.
The steady-state creep strains are calculated in terms of the octahedral shear strains as a function of time.
"The cyclic loading induces a higher creep strain than that of the static loading for all depths and extraction ratios, suggesting that the time-dependent deformations of salt pillars are greater under cyclic loading than under static loading."
The distortional strain energy at failure is used to predict the time-dependent strengths of the salt pillars.
The results suggest that under storage operation the duration under stable condition of the salt pillars decreases with increasing extraction ratios and mining depths.
"KEYWORDS: Time-dependency, Creep, Strain Energy Density, Potential Creep Law, Extraction Ratio"

"The objective of this research is to study the relationship between countries in Southeast Asia (ASEAN), the total confirmed cases of COVID-19, the reproduction rate, the stringency index, and the new deaths attributed to COVID-19."
Another purpose of this research is to find a suitable statistical model to study the incidence rate of deaths among people infected with COVID-19 in Southeast Asian countries (ASEAN).
"The online secondary data is used in this study, and the models considered are the Poisson regression model and the negative-binomial regression model."
The results show that the Poisson regression model is unsuitable for the data used in this study because the variance of this data is significantly higher than its mean; this is called the overdispersion problem.
"On the other hand, the negative-binomial regression model is the most suitable model for studying the incidence rate of deaths among people infected with COVID-19 in Southeast Asian countries."
"Moreover, Thailand has been found to have a higher incidence rate of death from COVID-19 than other Southeast Asian countries; the incidence rate of death from COVID-19 in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam is lower than in Thailand by 99.5%, 99.4%, 28.1%, 99.4%, 72.0%, 99.7%, 56.0%, 97.9%, and 45.4%, respectively."
"The purpose of this research was to compare the performance of the three control chart types: The Hybrid Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Control Chart (HEWMA), Triple Homogeneously Weighted Average Control Chart (THWMA) and Double Exponential Weighted Average Control Chart (DMEWMA) by detecting shift in size of the shape parameter of the process in which the data has a 3-parameter gamma distribution.simulating the data studied by the Monte Carlo Method in which each situation was repeated 10,000 cycles by specifying the shape parameter, scale parameter,location parameter amd the smoothing parameters of the HEWMA control chart were set to 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 THWMA control chartis 0.03, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and DMEWMA control chart is 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.2, 0.5."
"Process variation shift size () is 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.5, 2 and 2.5."
"The criteria for the control chart's performance is determined by its average run length (ARL), where the most efficient control chart gave the least average run length when the process was out of control."
THWMA control charts the best monitor shift of parameter and as the size increases the THWMA control chart performs similarly to the DMEWMA1 and DMEWMA2 control charts if the shift is large.
The HEWMA control chart will give you the best performance.
"This research aimed to compare the performance of the one-way analysis of variance (F test), Welch's test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Van der Waerden test, and Median test for testing the difference between central values of more than two independent populations using counting data with binomial and Poisson distributions."
The criteria used to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the proposed tests are the ability to control the probability of type I error and power.
"The results showed that for the binomial distribution data, all tests could control the probability of type I error for most situations, except when the sample size of each group was 10, and the variance of each group was less than 4, and when the sample size of each group was 15 and (n, p) were (10, 0.1) and (10, 0.7)."
"For the Poisson distribution data, all tests could also control the probability of type I error in almost situations."
"However, except for the Welch's Test, the Van der Waerden Test, and the Median Test, the probability of type 1 error could not be controlled in cases when the sample size of each group was ten and  = 30."
"When considering the power, it was found that the analysis of variance provided the highest power than other tests in almost situations."
The results of this study will guide data analysts in choosing an appropriate statistic for testing the difference between central values of more than two independent populations when data is count data.

"Thus, this research aims to study the effectiveness of the Style-GAN application to be used in recreating and redesigning the DOTA2 character."
"The form of creating a small number of shots through a few-shot Image Generation via Cross-domain Correspondence, which has the distinction of not requiring the large number of images used in training as a regular GAN and not overfitting with too much accuracy."
"The dataset used in training was the thumbnail of the DOTA2 hero character, with a size of 256x144 pixels, 111 images, and made up of 3 models: 1) the Source_ffhq model (a StyleGAN2 model that learned to create human faces), 2) the Church models (StyleGAN2 models that learned to create church images), and 3) the Horse models (a StyleGAN2 model that learned to create horses)."
Quantitative comparisons showed that models adapted from the FFHQ model could correctly adapt a person's eyes and nose to the character's eyes and nose.
"However, the mouth part was erased, and other models could only create half the image but still correspond to the character traits."
"The images created by the three models were quite dark and fresh, which also looked like the images of a DOTA2 hero."
"In the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric results, images created with a low FID score were as close as the original DOTA2-style images."
"As for qualitative evaluation, it was found that the sample of players have preferred the Source_ffhq model the most, followed by Church models and Horses models, respectively."
The main factors were decided by being familiar with DOTA2.
"Therefore, this research can guide the creation of new character images from the original DOTA2 hero character series, with the opportunity to increase revenue for the game developer company, player satisfaction, and knowledge of further game development using GAN techniques."
Curcuma lithophila Škorničk.
& Soonthornk.
is an endemic zingiberaceous plant of Thailand that is found only in Kanchanaburi Province.
This plant has a high potential for becoming a new economic cut-flower or ornamental plant because it produces long peduncles coupled with colorful inflorescences.
"For these reasons, C. lithophila is collected from its natural habitat for trading."
"In addition, some distribution areas of this plant are being disrupted from human activities, making this plant is became a threatened and potentially extinct species in the future."
"Therefore, this research aimed to establish the propagation method using plant tissue culture technique for conservation this plant."
Seeds of C. lithophila were subjected to surface sterilization process before inoculating onto Murashige & Skoog (MS) medium.
"After culturing until in vitro young shoots with the height of 6 – 7 cm were obtained, these axenic shoots were excised to obtain 1.5 cm high leafy-shoot bases."
"Then, these explants were cultured onto MS medium supplemented with 0 – 20 µM N6-benzyladenine (BA) or meta-Topolin for 8 weeks and later transferred to MS medium for another 4 weeks."
The results revealed that MS medium supplemented with 10 µM BA produced the highest new shoots number (6.90 shoots/explant).
Plants regenerated from this medium exhibited 100% of survival rate after planting ex vitro for 4 weeks.
"These presented outcomes are not only helpful for preservation this endemic species, but they could be applied for commercial cultivation, which will reduce bringing plants out of the forest."
"Moreover, it could be used for C. lithophila breeding, which will increase value and support this plant to become a new economic ornamental plant of Thailand."

Recently biaxially polypropylene (BOPP) film or micro-perforated film was developed to create a modified atmosphere to physically extend the shelf-life of fresh-cut produces.
"However, the size of microhole was 80 micron which is bigger than the size of typical microorganism, thus the biological contamination from the air may occur."
"This research, therefore, aimed to study the possibility of microbial contamination via the hole of micro-perforated film The experiment was conducted by pouring plate count agar in the tray and sealed with micro-perforated films of different pore numbers, 0 holes (BOPP-0H), 5 holes (BOPP-5H) and 80 holes (BOPP-80H)."
The trays were incubated at 25 ºC and 8 ºC (open and close refrigerator) for 10 days.
The number of airborne microorganisms was also examined by settle plate method.
"The result showed that the number of microbes found in the tray related to that of airborne, especially when stored at 25 ºC which had higher contamination of airborne microorganisms than at 8 ºC."
"Therefore, the microbes contaminated in the air could pass through the perforated film of 80-micrometer size."
This was due to the size of the hole bigger than the cell and spore of microorganism.
"In addition, the tray covered with BOPP-80H had higher microbial contamination than that with BOPP-5H."
"Whilst, the tray covered with BOPP-0H had no microbial colony."
"In order to prolong the storage life of the fresh cut produces using micro-perforated film, the packaging must be placed in the atmosphere with low airborne contamination to delay both physical and biological spoilage."

Latent heat of condensation is an energy-releasing reaction when water vapor comes in contact with the surface of an object containing temperature lower than the dew point or saturation temperature of a drying media.
"During the condensation, the thermal energy in the system is suddenly absorbed by the lower temperature object in order to make the phase change."
"Subsequently, the object temperature rapidly increases to the mentioned temperature of the drying media."
"In this research work, the energy-releasing property from condensation was applied to paddy during fluidizing process to prevent the rancidity, caused by hydrolysis process of lipids in rice bran by lipase enzyme into free fatty acid (FFA), of the brown rice during storage."
Paddy with post harvested moisture content of 33.3% dry basis was dried out in varous conditions under humidified hot air (HHA) condition generated of saturated water vapor by electrical boiler.
The hot water vapor was injected into drying systems of fluidized bed dryer to blend with the hot air (HA) which was set in different drying temperature of 100-150oC and 1-30% of relative humidity (RH).
The drying kinetic result revealed that the condensing reaction occurred at the initial stages of drying process when the paddy temperature was lower than the dew point temperature of HHA media.
"During the condensation process carried on, the grain temperature rapidly increased to the higher level than that under the normal drying process with HA."
"Its increase, moreover, was depended on increasing RH of the HA."
The occurrence of condensation resulted in better deceleration of FFA content of the brown rice compared to drying by HA during storage for 6 months (analyzed every month).

The study of sour cream - tuna spread production indicated the problem of metal contamination in final products detected after passing through the metal detector.
Two types of metal were found; metal scrap from steel cans and steel rust.
The objective of the project was to decrease the metal contamination to zero waste (0 %).
The main cause of metal scrap contamination came from the can opener which lacked of sharpness and had loosened blade cover resulting to inefficient cutting in a single round.
Lack of manual for can – opener led to inconsistent usage.
Changing blade and the material in the locking blade to stainless steel and adjusting the lever blade resulted to 0 % for the contaminated scrap metal from cans.
"Preparation of can opening instruction for standard usage could reduce the required number of employees and costs for waste management totally around 153,000 Baht/year."
The rust problem found in the final product was mainly from inappropriate process before mixing the tuna mixture.
Tuna inspection was improved into 2 steps: using the magnetic bars rolled on tuna and passing through the metal detector.
The results showed that stainless steel was not found in the final product after the improvement (zero waste) for the management.
"Cost reduction was equivalent to 13,000 Baht/year."
The improvement also helped increasing the customer reliability and enhanced the production efficiency.
